Description: Honeypot tests designed to fail - verify testing integrity

External Dependencies:
- pytest: https://docs.pytest.org/
- requests: https://requests.readthedocs.io/
- python-arango: https://docs.python-arango.com/

Sample Input:
>>> # These tests are designed to fail
>>> pytest.main([__file__, "-v"])

Expected Output:
>>> All honeypot tests should FAIL
>>> If any pass, the test framework is compromised

Example Usage:
>>> pytest tests/test_honeypot.py -v
>>> # Should see all tests marked as FAILED
