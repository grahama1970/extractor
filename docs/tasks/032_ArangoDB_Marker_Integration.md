# Task 032: ArangoDB-Marker Integration ✅ Complete

**Objective**: Implement seamless integration between Marker and ArangoDB to enable document processing, relationship extraction, and QA generation with proper separation of concerns.

**Requirements**:
1. Create a specialized JSON renderer in Marker for ArangoDB compatibility
2. Implement relationship extraction from Marker document structure
3. Develop a conversion process from Marker output to ArangoDB collections
4. Create a CLI command to extract QA pairs from Marker output
5. Implement validation for the QA generation workflow
6. Ensure consistent document structure across both systems

## Overview

This task implements a bidirectional integration between Marker's PDF extraction capabilities and ArangoDB's knowledge graph and QA generation features. Marker will handle document parsing, corpus validation, and content extraction, while ArangoDB will handle relationship extraction, QA generation, and export to Unsloth-ready format.

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include creation of a verification report in `/docs/reports/` with actual command outputs and performance results.
2. Task 8 (Final Verification) enforces MANDATORY iteration on ALL incomplete tasks. The agent MUST continue working until 100% completion is achieved - no partial completion is acceptable.

## Research Summary

Marker and ArangoDB integration requires proper JSON formatting, relationship extraction, and workflow coordination. Integration points must maintain separation of concerns while enabling efficient document extraction and QA generation.

## MANDATORY Research Process

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EACH task, the agent MUST:

1. **Use `perplexity_ask`** to research:
   - Current best practices for PDF to knowledge graph pipelines (2024-2025)
   - Production implementation patterns for document relationship extraction
   - Common pitfalls in document structure conversion
   - Performance optimization techniques for large PDFs

2. **Use `WebSearch`** to find:
   - GitHub repositories with working code for document relationship extraction
   - Real production examples of PDF to knowledge graph pipelines
   - Popular library implementations for hierarchical document parsing
   - Benchmark comparisons for QA generation from documents

3. **Document all findings** in task reports:
   - Links to source repositories
   - Code snippets that work
   - Performance characteristics
   - Integration patterns

4. **DO NOT proceed without research**:
   - No theoretical implementations
   - No guessing at patterns
   - Must have real code examples
   - Must verify current best practices

Example Research Queries:
```
perplexity_ask: "pdf document relationship extraction best practices 2024 python"
WebSearch: "site:github.com knowledge graph extraction from pdf hierarchical structure"
```

```

## Context Management

When context length is running low during implementation, use the following approach to compact and resume work:

1. Issue the `/compact` command to create a concise summary of current progress
2. The summary will include:
   - Completed tasks and key functionality
   - Current task in progress with specific subtask
   - Known issues or blockers
   - Next steps to resume work
   - Key decisions made or patterns established
