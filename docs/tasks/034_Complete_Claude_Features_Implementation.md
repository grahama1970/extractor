# Task 034: Complete Claude Features Implementation ⏳ Not Started

**Objective**: Implement the remaining Claude features (section_verification, content_validation, structure_analysis) and add multimodal image description capabilities using background Claude Code instances.

**Requirements**:
1. Implement section_verification to verify and correct document section hierarchy
2. Implement content_validation for overall document structure validation
3. Implement structure_analysis for document organization analysis
4. Add multimodal image description using Claude's vision capabilities
5. All features must use background Claude Code instances (not API)
6. Maintain consistent performance with existing table_merge_analysis
7. Update documentation to reflect all working features

## Overview

Currently, the marker project promises 4 Claude features but only implements table_merge_analysis. This task completes the implementation to align functionality with documentation promises. Additionally, we'll leverage Claude Code's new multimodal capabilities for enhanced image description.

**IMPORTANT**: 
1. Each sub-task MUST include creation of a verification report in `/docs/reports/` with actual command outputs and performance results.
2. Task 6 (Final Verification) enforces MANDATORY iteration on ALL incomplete tasks. The agent MUST continue working until 100% completion is achieved - no partial completion is acceptable.

## Research Summary

Claude Code background instances can analyze document structure, verify section hierarchies, validate content organization, and now describe images using multimodal capabilities. This implementation will follow the established pattern from table_merge_analysis.

## MANDATORY Research Process

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: For EACH task, the agent MUST:

1. **Use `perplexity_ask`** to research:
   - Claude Code multimodal capabilities 2025
   - Document section hierarchy verification techniques
   - Content validation patterns for PDFs
   - Document structure analysis best practices
   - Background process patterns for AI instances

2. **Use `WebSearch`** to find:
   - GitHub repos using Claude for document analysis
   - Section hierarchy verification implementations
   - Document validation frameworks
   - Multimodal PDF processing examples
   - Background task queue patterns

3. **Document all findings** in task reports:
   - Links to source repositories
   - Code snippets that work
   - Performance characteristics
   - Integration patterns

4. **DO NOT proceed without research**:
   - No theoretical implementations
   - No guessing at patterns
   - Must have real code examples
   - Must verify current best practices

Example Research Queries:
```
perplexity_ask: "claude code multimodal image description 2025 best practices"
WebSearch: "site:github.com document section hierarchy verification AI"
perplexity_ask: "document content validation patterns PDF processing"
WebSearch: "site:github.com claude background instance document analysis"
```

## Context Management

When context length is running low during implementation, use the following approach to compact and resume work:

1. Issue the `/compact` command to create a concise summary of current progress
2. The summary will include:
   - Completed tasks and key functionality
   - Current task in progress with specific subtask
   - Known issues or blockers
   - Next steps to resume work
   - Key decisions made or patterns established
