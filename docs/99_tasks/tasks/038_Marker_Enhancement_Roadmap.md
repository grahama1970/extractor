# Task 038: Marker Enhancement Roadmap

## Status: ðŸ“‹ PLANNED

## Objective
Enhance Marker's extraction capabilities to match or exceed modern document extraction tools like Apache Tika and Unstructured.io, while maintaining its AI-powered advantages.

## Current State Analysis

### Marker's Strengths
- âœ… AI-powered enhancements (Claude integration)
- âœ… Advanced table extraction and merging
- âœ… Native extractors for major formats
- âœ… Unified output schema
- âœ… ArangoDB integration
- âœ… MCP server for agent integration

### Missing Features (Compared to Modern Tools)

## Priority 1: Essential Missing Features

### 1.1 PDF Annotation and Form Support
- **Gap**: No extraction of PDF annotations, comments, or form fields
- **Impact**: Cannot process interactive PDFs or review comments
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Add to PDF provider
  - Extract annotations (highlights, comments, sticky notes)
  - Extract form fields (text fields, checkboxes, dropdowns)
  - Extract digital signatures
  - Use PyPDF2 or pdfplumber
  ```

### 1.2 Document Metadata Extraction
- **Gap**: Limited metadata extraction (no author, dates, properties)
- **Impact**: Missing crucial document context
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # New metadata extractor
  - PDF metadata (title, author, subject, keywords)
  - DOCX/PPTX properties
  - EXIF data from embedded images
  - Creation/modification dates
  ```

### 1.3 Archive and Bundle Support
- **Gap**: Cannot process ZIP/TAR/compressed files
- **Impact**: Cannot handle document collections
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # New archive provider
  - ZIP/TAR extraction
  - Recursive document processing
  - Maintain folder structure in output
  ```

## Priority 2: Professional Features

### 2.1 Email Format Support
- **Gap**: No EML/MSG file support
- **Impact**: Cannot process email archives
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Email provider
  - Extract email headers
  - Process attachments
  - Preserve email thread structure
  ```

### 2.2 Security Features
- **Gap**: No password-protected file support
- **Impact**: Cannot process secured documents
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Security handler
  - Password-protected PDF/DOCX
  - Encryption detection
  - Secure credential handling
  ```

### 2.3 Structured Data Formats
- **Gap**: No direct CSV/JSON support
- **Impact**: Requires conversion overhead
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Data providers
  - Native CSV parser
  - JSON/JSONL processing
  - Parquet file support
  ```

## Priority 3: Advanced Features

### 3.1 Change Tracking
- **Gap**: No document revision tracking
- **Impact**: Cannot see document evolution
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Revision extractor
  - DOCX tracked changes
  - PDF revision history
  - Version comparison
  ```

### 3.2 Multimedia Support
- **Gap**: No audio/video text extraction
- **Impact**: Cannot process multimedia content
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Multimedia providers
  - Audio transcription (via Whisper)
  - Video frame extraction
  - Subtitle/caption processing
  ```

### 3.3 CAD/Technical Formats
- **Gap**: No engineering drawing support
- **Impact**: Cannot process technical documents
- **Implementation**:
  ```python
  # Technical providers
  - DWG/DXF basic extraction
  - SVG processing
  - Visio diagram support
  ```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Gaps (Month 1)
1. PDF annotation extraction
2. Document metadata module
3. Archive support
4. Update README with accurate claims

### Phase 2: Professional (Month 2)
1. Email format support
2. Security features
3. CSV/JSON providers

### Phase 3: Advanced (Month 3)
1. Change tracking
2. Basic multimedia support
3. Performance optimization

## Integration with Granger

### Benefits to Ecosystem
- GitGet handles code â†’ Marker handles all documents
- Complete extraction coverage across modules
- Enhanced knowledge graph in ArangoDB

### Cross-Module Workflows
```python
# Example: Complete project documentation
1. GitGet: Extract repository structure
2. Marker: Process all docs including:
   - README.md files
   - PDF specifications (with annotations)
   - Email discussions (new!)
   - Archived documentation (new!)
3. ArangoDB: Store complete knowledge graph
```

## Success Metrics

1. **Format Coverage**: Support 95% of common document formats
2. **Feature Parity**: Match Apache Tika's core features
3. **Performance**: Maintain current speed with new features
4. **Quality**: AI enhancements remain differentiator

## Risks and Mitigations

1. **Complexity**: Start with most requested features
2. **Dependencies**: Use established libraries (PyPDF2, python-docx)
3. **Performance**: Implement lazy loading for large archives
4. **Security**: Follow best practices for password handling

## Conclusion

By implementing these enhancements, Marker will:
- Match modern extraction tools in capability
- Maintain its AI-powered advantages
- Become the comprehensive document extraction solution in Granger
- Enable new cross-module workflows

The phased approach ensures quick wins while building toward comprehensive coverage.
