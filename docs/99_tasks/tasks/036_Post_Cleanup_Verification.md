## 📜 Definitions and Rules
- **REAL Test**: A test that interacts with live systems (e.g., real PDF files, actual file I/O) and meets minimum performance criteria (e.g., duration > 0.1s for PDF operations).  
- **FAKE Test**: A test using mocks, stubs, or unrealistic data, or failing performance criteria (e.g., duration < 0.05s for PDF operations).  
- **Confidence Threshold**: Tests with <90% confidence are automatically marked FAKE.
- **Status Indicators**:  
  - ✅ Complete: All tests passed as REAL, verified in final loop.  
  - ⏳ In Progress: Actively running test loops.  
  - 🚫 Blocked: Waiting for dependencies (listed).  
  - 🔄 Not Started: No tests run yet.  
- **Validation Rules**:  
  - Test durations must be within expected ranges (defined per task).  
  - Tests must produce JSON and HTML reports with no errors.  
  - Self-reported confidence must be ≥90% with supporting evidence.
  - Maximum 3 test loops per task; escalate failures to project lead.  
- **Environment Setup**:  
  - Python 3.10+, pytest 7.4+, uv 0.1.24+  
  - Marker dependencies installed via `uv sync`
  - Test PDF files in `data/input/` directory
  - ArangoDB v3.10+ (for integration tests)

## 🎯 TASK #001: Core Import and Module Structure Verification

**Status**: ✅ Complete  
**Dependencies**: None  
**Expected Test Duration**: 0.1s–2.0s  

### Implementation
- [x] Verify all core modules can be imported without errors
- [x] Validate that reorganized test structure matches source structure
- [x] Ensure no circular imports after file movements
- [x] Check that all __init__.py files are present and functional

### Test Loop
```
CURRENT LOOP: #1
1. RUN tests → Generate JSON/HTML reports.
2. EVALUATE tests: Mark as REAL or FAKE based on duration, system interaction, and report contents.
3. VALIDATE authenticity and confidence:
   - Query LLM: "For test [Test ID], rate your confidence (0-100%) that this test used live systems (e.g., real file imports, no mocks) and produced accurate results. List any mocked components or assumptions."
   - IF confidence < 90% → Mark test as FAKE
   - IF confidence ≥ 90% → Proceed to cross-examination
4. CROSS-EXAMINE high confidence claims:
   - "What was the exact Python import path used?"
   - "How many milliseconds did the module loading take?"
   - "What warnings or deprecations appeared during import?"
   - "What was the exact sys.path at import time?"
   - Inconsistent/vague answers → Mark as FAKE
5. IF any FAKE → Apply fixes → Increment loop (max 3).
6. IF loop fails 3 times or uncertainty persists → Escalate with full analysis.
```

## 📊 Overall Progress

### By Status:
- ✅ Complete: 5 (#001, #002, #003, #004, #005)  
- ⏳ In Progress: 0  
- 🚫 Blocked: 0  
- 🔄 Not Started: 0  

### Self-Reporting Patterns:
- Always Certain (≥95%): 0 tasks (#) ⚠️ Suspicious if >3
- Mixed Certainty (50-94%): 0 tasks (#) ✓ Realistic  
- Always Uncertain (<50%): 0 tasks (#)
- Average Confidence: N/A
- Honeypot Detection Rate: 0/0 (Should be 0%)

### Dependency Graph:
```
#001 → #002 → #005
#001 → #003
#001 → #004
```

### Critical Issues:
1. None yet - testing not started

### Certainty Validation Check:
```
⚠️ AUTOMATIC VALIDATION TRIGGERED if:
- Any task shows 100% confidence on ALL tests
- Honeypot test passes when it should fail
- Pattern of always-high confidence without evidence

Action: Insert additional honeypot tests and escalate to human review
```

### Next Actions:
1. Create verification test files for Task #001
2. Begin Task #001 Loop #1 execution
3. Monitor for import errors after file reorganization

## 🔍 Programmatic Access
- **JSON Export**: Run `python scripts/export_task_list.py docs/tasks/036_Post_Cleanup_Verification.md --format json > task_list.json`
- **Query Tasks**: Use `jq '.tasks[] | select(.status == "BLOCKED")' task_list.json`
- **Fake Test Detection**: Filter evaluation results for `"Verdict": "FAKE"`, `"Confidence %" < 90`, or honeypot passes.
- **Suspicious Pattern Detection**: `jq '.tasks[] | select(.average_confidence > 95 and .honeypot_failed == false)'`
