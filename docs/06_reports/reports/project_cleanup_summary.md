# Project Cleanup Summary

Date: May 28, 2025

## Overview

This report summarizes the comprehensive cleanup and reorganization performed on the Marker project to ensure a clean, well-organized structure that follows best practices.

## Actions Completed

### 1. Organized Stray Source Files in Project Root ✓

**Files Moved:**
- `test_section_verification.py` → `tests/integration/`
- `fix_imports.py` → `scripts/utils/`

These were the only stray Python files in the project root. Both have been moved to appropriate locations.

### 2. Log Files Organization ✓

**Status:** Log files were already properly organized in the `logs/` directory:
- `logs/cleanup_log.md`
- `logs/extraction_log.txt`

No additional organization was needed for log files.

### 3. Test Files Reorganization to Mirror src Structure ✓

**Major Changes:**
The test structure has been reorganized to mirror the `src/marker/` directory structure:

```
tests/
├── cli/                # Mirrors src/marker/cli/
├── core/               # Mirrors src/marker/core/
│   ├── arangodb/
│   ├── builders/
│   ├── config/
│   ├── converters/
│   ├── llm_call/
│   ├── processors/
│   ├── providers/
│   ├── renderers/
│   ├── schema/
│   └── services/
├── mcp/                # Mirrors src/marker/mcp/
├── features/           # Feature integration tests
├── integration/        # End-to-end integration tests
├── metadata/           # Metadata-specific tests
├── package/            # Package build tests
└── verification/       # Verification tests
```

**Specific Moves:**
- All tests from `tests/arangodb/` → `tests/core/arangodb/`
- All tests from `tests/processors/` → `tests/core/processors/`
- All tests from `tests/builders/` → `tests/core/builders/`
- All tests from `tests/config/` → `tests/core/config/`
- All tests from `tests/converters/` → `tests/core/converters/`
- All tests from `tests/providers/` → `tests/core/providers/`
- All tests from `tests/renderers/` → `tests/core/renderers/`
- All tests from `tests/services/` → `tests/core/services/`
- All tests from `tests/llm_call/` → `tests/core/llm_call/`
- Code processor tests → `tests/core/processors/code/`
- ArangoDB integration tests → `tests/integration/arangodb/`

### 4. Removed Debug/Iteration Files ✓

**Files Archived:**
- `utils/debug_python_type_hints.py` → `archive/utils_debug/`
- `utils/examine_code_blocks.py` → `archive/utils_debug/`
- `utils/show_code_blocks.py` → `archive/utils_debug/`
- `utils/show_code_blocks_fixed.py` → `archive/utils_debug/`
- `scripts/debug_table_detection.py` → `archive/debug_scripts/`

**Test Files Moved:**
- `scripts/test_claude_features.py` → `tests/features/`
- `scripts/cli/test_mcp_functionality.py` → `tests/cli/`

### 5. Archived Unorganized Markdown/JSON Files ✓

**Files Archived:**
- `CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` → `archive/docs/`
- `INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md` → `archive/docs/`
- `README_VERIFICATION_REPORT.md` → `archive/docs/`

**Files Kept in Root (Important Project Files):**
- `README.md` - Main project documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Project changelog
- `CLAUDE.md` - Claude-specific configuration
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - Project structure documentation
- `CLA.md` - Contributor License Agreement
- `requirements.json` - Requirements specification
- `marker_mcp.json` - MCP configuration
- `marker_mcp_full.json` - Full MCP configuration

### 6. Updated tests/README.md ✓

The tests README has been updated with:
- New directory structure reflecting the reorganization
- Updated paths to match `src/marker/` structure
- Updated examples using `uv run pytest` commands
- Clear instructions for running all test categories
- Proper documentation of test organization principles

## Benefits of This Cleanup

1. **Improved Organization**: Tests now mirror the exact source structure, making it easy to find tests for any module
2. **Cleaner Root**: No stray Python files in the project root
3. **Archived Debug Files**: Debug and utility files are preserved but moved out of the way
4. **Better Documentation**: Updated README provides clear guidance for running and writing tests
5. **Consistency**: All test commands now use `uv run` for consistency with the project's package management

## Next Steps

1. Run the full test suite to ensure all tests still pass after reorganization:
   ```bash
   uv run pytest tests/
   ```

2. Update any CI/CD configurations if they reference old test paths

3. Consider adding pre-commit hooks to maintain the clean structure

4. Review archived files periodically and remove if no longer needed

## Summary

All 6 cleanup tasks have been completed successfully. The project now has a clean, well-organized structure that follows Python best practices and makes it easier for developers to navigate and contribute to the codebase.
