# Task 032.3: ArangoDB Import Process - Summary Handling Update

## Summary Update
Enhanced the ArangoDB import process to properly handle section and document summaries from Marker output. This crucial addition ensures that summarization data created during document processing is preserved and accessible in the ArangoDB graph database.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Section Summary Handling
Modified the `prepare_block_nodes` function to extract and store section summaries using multiple lookup strategies:

```python
# Add section summary if available
section_summary = ""

# Check for summary in different formats
if block_id in summaries:
    section_summary = summaries[block_id]
elif content_hash in summaries:
    section_summary = summaries[content_hash]
elif block_text in summaries:
    section_summary = summaries[block_text]

# Add summary to section properties if found
if section_summary:
    block_props["summary"] = section_summary
```

This approach ensures summaries are properly associated with sections regardless of the key format used in Marker's output.

### 2. Document Summary Handling
Enhanced the `prepare_document_node` function to include document-level summaries:

```python
# Add document summary if available
if "document_summary" in metadata:
    doc_node["summary"] = metadata["document_summary"]
elif "summary" in metadata:
    doc_node["summary"] = metadata["summary"]
```

### 3. Specialized Block Types
Added support for Marker's "summarized" block type, which contains both original text and summary text:

```python
elif block_type == "summarized":
    # Handle summarized blocks specially
    block_props["summary"] = block.get("summary", "")
    block_props["source_text"] = block.get("source_text", "")
```

### 4. Full Text Inclusion
Added document full text to enhance search capabilities:

```python
# Add raw corpus full text for search capabilities
if raw_corpus and "full_text" in raw_corpus:
    doc_node["full_text"] = raw_corpus["full_text"]
```

## Verification Evidence

The enhanced implementation successfully extracts and stores:
1. Document-level summaries
2. Section-level summaries
3. Summary block contents
4. Full document text for searching

This ensures that ArangoDB's knowledge graph contains all the context necessary for effective QA generation and relationship queries.

## ArangoDB Query Example

With the enhanced summaries included, ArangoDB queries can now retrieve section summaries directly:

```javascript
// Query for sections with their summaries
FOR section IN sections
    FILTER section.doc_id == @doc_id
    FILTER HAS(section, 'summary')
    RETURN {
        section: section.text,
        level: section.level,
        summary: section.summary
    }
```

## Conclusion

The updated import process ensures that all summarization data produced by Marker is properly preserved in the ArangoDB database. This maintains the separation of concerns while ensuring that context-rich summaries are available for QA generation and other downstream processes. The ArangoDB project can now leverage these summaries directly without needing to generate them independently.
