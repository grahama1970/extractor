# Task: Debug and Validate ArangoDB Vector Index Functionality

## Objective
Run and debug the `arango_vector_index_debug.py` example script to ensure all ArangoDB vector index functionality works correctly with real-world results. The script should run without errors, properly connect to ArangoDB, create vector indexes, and perform similarity searches.

## Success Criteria
- The script runs successfully without errors
- All validation tests pass
- Connection to ArangoDB is established
- Vector indexes are created with proper configuration
- Documents with embeddings are successfully inserted
- Vector searches produce semantically relevant results

## Environment Setup
1. Ensure the project is cloned and available at `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/`
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed via `uv pip install -e .` from the project root
3. Verify that ArangoDB is installed and running
4. Set environment variables for ArangoDB connection if necessary:
   ```bash
   export ARANGO_HOST=localhost
   export ARANGO_PORT=8529
   export ARANGO_USERNAME=root
   export ARANGO_PASSWORD=openSesame
   ```

## Steps

### Step 1: Inspect the Example Script
- Review the code in `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/examples/simple/arango_vector_index_debug.py`
- Verify that it follows the requirements in CLAUDE.md
- Confirm that all functions have appropriate error handling and validation

### Step 2: Verify Dependencies
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/
python -c "import arango; from marker.utils.embedding_utils import get_embedding; print('Dependencies available')"
```

### Step 3: Verify ArangoDB Connection
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/
# Extract and run just the ArangoDB connection test
python -c "
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
try:
    from arango import ArangoClient
    client = ArangoClient(hosts='http://localhost:8529')
    sys_db = client.db('_system', username='root', password='openSesame')
    version = sys_db.version()
    print(f'Connected to ArangoDB version: {version}')
except Exception as e:
    print(f'Failed to connect to ArangoDB: {e}')
    sys.exit(1)
"
```

### Step 4: Run the Script with Basic Validation
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/
python examples/simple/arango_vector_index_debug.py
```

### Step 5: Debug ArangoDB Connection Issues (if any)
If the script fails to connect to ArangoDB:
1. Verify that ArangoDB is running: `curl http://localhost:8529/_api/version`
2. Check the connection credentials
3. Ensure no network restrictions are blocking the connection
4. Update the script with correct credentials if necessary

### Step 6: Debug Vector Index Creation Issues (if any)
If vector index creation fails:
1. Check if the ArangoDB version supports vector indexes
2. Verify the index configuration parameters
3. Try with different dimensions or parameters if necessary
4. Update the script if needed

### Step 7: Debug Vector Search Issues (if any)
If vector search does not produce expected results:
1. Check the AQL query syntax
2. Verify that COSINE_SIMILARITY function is available
3. Try with APPROX_NEAR function if available
4. Update the script to improve search results if necessary

### Step 8: Verify Real-World Results
To confirm that the results are valid and not mocked:
1. Connect to ArangoDB web interface and verify the created collections and indexes
2. Check that documents are actually inserted with embeddings
3. Run manual AQL queries to verify search results
4. Verify that search results are semantically relevant to the queries

## Expected Results
1. All validation tests pass with success message
2. ArangoDB connection is established successfully
3. Vector index is created with correct configuration
4. Documents with embeddings are inserted successfully
5. Vector searches return semantically relevant results

## Troubleshooting
- If ArangoDB connection fails, check if the service is running and accessible
- If vector index creation fails, check ArangoDB version (3.9+ required for vector indexes)
- If embeddings fail to generate, check if the model is properly installed and accessible
- If search results are poor, try different AQL queries or similarity thresholds

## Next Steps
After successful debugging and validation:
1. Document any issues encountered and their solutions
2. Consider integrating the ArangoDB vector search functionality into the main Marker application
3. Explore advanced features like hybrid search combining text and vector search
4. Optimize ArangoDB configuration for production use
