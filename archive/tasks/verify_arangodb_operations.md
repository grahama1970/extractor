# Verify ArangoDB Operations

## Objective
Create a script to verify all basic ArangoDB operations (connection, database creation, CRUD operations) to ensure the marker system can properly interact with ArangoDB.

## Tasks
- [x] Verify ArangoDB connection setup with credentials
- [x] Create 'marker' database in ArangoDB if it doesn't exist
- [x] Implement and test collection creation
- [x] Implement and test document insertion
- [x] Implement and test querying documents
- [x] Implement and test updating documents
- [x] Implement and test deleting documents
- [x] Create comprehensive verification script

## Environment Configuration
- ARANGO_HOST=localhost
- ARANGO_USERNAME=root
- ARANGO_PASSWORD=openSesame

## Implementation Results
Created a comprehensive verification script at:
`/home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/examples/simple/arangodb_operations_debug.py`

The script:
1. Verifies connection to ArangoDB
2. Creates 'marker' database if it doesn't exist
3. Sets up document and edge collections
4. Performs all CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
5. Demonstrates AQL query capabilities
6. Provides detailed validation feedback

## Usage
Run the script from the project root directory:
```bash
python examples/simple/arangodb_operations_debug.py
```

The script will create the marker database and test collections if they don't exist, then run through all operations to verify they work properly.

## Built-in Verification
The script includes its own validation logic to verify that:
- Connection to ArangoDB is successful
- Database creation/connection works
- Collections can be created
- Documents can be inserted, queried, updated, and deleted
- AQL queries run correctly

Each test produces clear ✅ success or ❌ failure indicators.
