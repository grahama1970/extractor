# Task: Debug and Validate Vector Search Functionality

## Objective
Run and debug the `vector_search_debug.py` example script to ensure all vector search functionality works correctly with real-world results. The script should run without errors and produce valid, non-mocked embeddings and search results.

## Success Criteria
- The script runs successfully without errors
- All validation tests pass
- Embeddings are generated with expected dimensions
- Vector search produces semantically relevant results
- Performance benchmarks complete successfully

## Environment Setup
1. Ensure the project is cloned and available at `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/`
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed via `uv pip install -e .` from the project root
3. Verify the embedding models are accessible

## Steps

### Step 1: Inspect the Example Script
- Review the code in `/home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/examples/simple/vector_search_debug.py`
- Verify that it follows the requirements in CLAUDE.md
- Confirm that all functions have appropriate error handling and validation

### Step 2: Verify Dependencies
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/
python -c "from marker.utils.embedding_utils import get_embedding; print('Embedding utilities available')"
```

### Step 3: Run the Script with Basic Validation
```bash
cd /home/graham/workspace/experiments/marker/
python examples/simple/vector_search_debug.py
```

### Step 4: Debug Embedding Generation Issues (if any)
If the script fails to generate embeddings:
1. Check that the embedding model is accessible
2. Verify the model dimensions match the expected output
3. Try with smaller text samples if necessary
4. Update the script if needed

### Step 5: Debug Vector Search Issues (if any)
If vector search does not produce expected results:
1. Check the cosine similarity implementation
2. Verify that the sample corpus is appropriate for testing
3. Try different queries to ensure consistent behavior
4. Update the script to improve search results if necessary

### Step 6: Verify Real-World Results
To confirm that the results are valid and not mocked:
1. Compare embeddings from different but similar texts - they should have high similarity
2. Compare embeddings from different topics - they should have lower similarity
3. Verify that the search results are semantically relevant to the queries
4. Check that embedding dimensions match the expected model output (e.g., 1024 for BGE-large-en)

### Step 7: Performance Optimization (if needed)
If the script runs slowly:
1. Check for optimization opportunities in the embedding generation
2. Consider batching embeddings for multiple texts
3. Profile the performance bottlenecks

## Expected Results
1. All validation tests pass with success message
2. Vector embeddings have the correct dimensions (e.g., 1024 for BGE-large-en)
3. Search queries return semantically relevant results
4. Performance benchmarks complete within reasonable time

## Troubleshooting
- If embeddings fail to generate, check if the model is properly installed and accessible
- If search results are poor, try different similarity thresholds or different queries
- If performance is slow, consider using smaller test data or batch processing

## Next Steps
After successful debugging and validation:
1. Document any issues encountered and their solutions
2. Consider integrating the vector search functionality into the main Marker application
3. Explore advanced features like hybrid search combining text and vector search
