Recent RLVR works that operate under the *zero setting* avoid supervision in labeling the reasoning process, but still depend on manually curated collections of questions and answers for training. The scarcity of highquality, human-produced examples raises concerns about the long-term scalability of relying on human supervision, a challenge already evident in the domain of language model pretraining. Furthermore, in a hypothetical future where AI surpasses human intelligence, tasks provided by humans may offer limited learning potential for a superintelligent system. To address these concerns, we propose a new RLVR paradigm called *Absolute Zero*, in which a single model learns to propose tasks that maximize its own learning progress and improves reasoning by solving them, without relying on any external data. Under this paradigm, we introduce the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system that self-evolves its training curriculum and reasoning ability by using a code executor to both validate proposed code reasoning tasks and verify answers, serving as an unified source of verifiable reward to guide open-ended yet grounded learning. Despite being trained entirely *without external data*, AZR achieves overall SOTA performance on coding and mathematical reasoning tasks, *outperforming existing zero-setting models* that rely on tens of thousands of *in-domain human-curated examples*. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AZR can be effectively applied across different model scales and is compatible with various model classes.\n![](_page_0_Figure_7.jpeg)\n*Figure 1.* **Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR) achieves state-of-the-art performance with ZERO DATA**. Without relying on any gold labels or human-defined queries, Absolute Zero Reasoner trained using our proposed self-play approach demonstrates impressive general reasoning capabilities improvements in both math and coding, despite operating entirely out-of-distribution. Remarkably, AZR surpasses models trained on tens of thousands of expert-labeled in-domain examples in the combined average score across both domains.\n*Corresponding author(s)*\n**Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data**\n![](_page_1_Figure_1.jpeg)\nLess Human Supervision\n<span id=\"page-1-0\"></span>*Figure 2.* **Absolute Zero Paradigm.

In contrast, we introduce a new paradigm, **Absolute Zero**, for training reasoning models without any human-curated data. We envision that the agent should autonomously propose tasks optimized for learnability and learn how to solve them using an unified model. The agent learns by interacting with an environment that provides verifiable feedback, enabling reliable and continuous self-improvement entirely without human intervention."

Introduction**\", \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c14\"}] -->\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable improvements in reasoning capabilities by employing Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) [\\(Lambert et al.,](#page-15-0) [2024\\)](#page-15-0). Unlike methods that explicitly imitate intermediate reasoning steps, RLVR uses only outcome-based feedback, enabling large-scale reinforcement learning over vast task datasets [\\(DeepSeek-AI et al.,](#page-13-0) [2025;](#page-13-0) [Team et al.,](#page-16-0) [2025;](#page-16-0) [Jaech et al.,](#page-14-0) [2024;](#page-14-0) [OpenAI,](#page-15-1) [2025b;](#page-15-1)[a\\)](#page-15-2). A particularly compelling variant is the *\"zero\"* RLVR paradigm [\\(DeepSeek-AI](#page-13-0) [et al.,](#page-13-0) [2025\\)](#page-13-0), which forgoes any cold-start distillation data, using neither human-generated nor AI-generated reasoning traces, and applies RLVR directly on the base model with task rewards. However, these methods still depend heavily on expertly curated distributions of reasoning question\u2013answer pairs, which raises serious concerns about their long-term scalability [\\(Villalobos et al.,](#page-16-1) [2024\\)](#page-16-1). As reasoning models continue to advance, the effort required to construct large-scale, high-quality datasets may soon become unsustainable [\\(Yue](#page-17-0) [et al.,](#page-17-0) [2025\\)](#page-17-0). A similar scalability bottleneck has already been identified in the domain of LLM pretraining [\\(Sutskever et al.,](#page-16-2) [2024\\)](#page-16-2). Furthermore, as AI systems continue to evolve and potentially exceed human intellect, an exclusive dependence on human-designed tasks risks imposing constraints on their capacity for autonomous learning and growth [\\(Hughes et al.,](#page-14-1) [2024\\)](#page-14-1). This underscores the need for a new paradigm that begins to explore possibilities beyond the constraints of human-designed tasks and prepares for a future in which AI systems may surpass human intelligence.\nTo this end, we propose *\"Absolute Zero\"*, a new paradigm for reasoning models in which the model simultaneously learns to define tasks that maximize learnability and to solve them effectively, enabling self-evolution through self-play without relying on external data. In contrast to prior self-play methods that are limited to narrow domains, fixed functionalities, or learned reward models that are prone to hacking [\\(Silver et al.,](#page-16-3) [2017;](#page-16-3) [Chen et al.,](#page-13-1) [2025;](#page-13-1) [2024\\)](#page-13-2), the *Absolute Zero* paradigm is designed to operate in open-ended settings while remaining grounded in a real environment. It relies on feedback from the environment as a verifiable source of reward, mirroring how humans learn and reason through interaction with the world, and helps prevent issues such as hacking with neural reward models [\\(Hughes](#page-14-1) [et al.,](#page-14-1) [2024\\)](#page-14-1). Similar to AlphaZero [\\(Silver et al.,](#page-16-3) [2017\\)](#page-16-3), which improves through self-play, our proposed paradigm requires no human supervision and learns entirely through self-interaction. We believe the Absolute Zero paradigm represents a promising step toward enabling large language models to autonomously achieve superhuman reasoning capabilities.\nBuilding on this new reasoning paradigm, we introduce the *Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR)*, which proposes and solves coding tasks. We cast code executor as an open-ended yet grounded environment, sufficient to both validate task integrity and also provide verifiable feedback for stable training. We let AZR construct three types of coding tasks: infer and reason about one particular element in a program, input, output triplet, which corresponds to three complementary modes of reasoning: induction, abduction, and deduction. We train the entire system end-to-end with a newly proposed reinforcement learning advantage estimator tailored to the multitask nature of the proposed approach.\nDespite being trained entirely without any in-distribution data, AZR demonstrates remarkable capabilities across diverse reasoning tasks in math and coding. In mathematics, AZR achieves competitive performance compared to zero reasoner models explicitly fine-tuned with domain-specific supervision. In coding tasks, AZR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models specifically trained with code datasets using RLVR. Furthermore, AZR outperforms all previous models by an average of 1.8 absolute points compared to models trained in the \"zero\" setting using in-domain data. These surprising results highlight that general reasoning skills can emerge without human-curated domain targeted data, positioning Absolute Zero as an promising research direction and AZR as a first pivotal milestone. Besides the remarkable results AZR achieved with zero human data for reasoning, we also make very interesting findings summarized below:\n- **Code priors amplify reasoning.** The base Qwen-Coder-7b model started with math performance 3.6 points lower than Qwen-7b. But after AZR training for both models, the coder variant surpassed the base by 0.7 points, suggesting that strong coding capabilities may potentially amplify overall reasoning improvements after AZR training.\n- **Cross domain transfer is more pronounced for AZR.** After RLVR, expert code models raise math accuracy by only 0.65 points on average, whereas AZR-Base-7B and AZR-Coder-7B trained on self-proposed code reasoning tasks improve math average by 10.9 and 15.2, respectively, demonstrating much stronger generalized reasoning capability gains.\n- **Bigger bases yield bigger gains.** Performance improvements scale with model size: the 3B, 7B, and 14B coder models gain +5.7, +10.2, and +13.2 points respectively, suggesting continued scaling is advantageous for AZR.\n- **Comments as intermediate plans emerge naturally.** When solving code induction tasks, AZR often interleaves step-by-step plans as comments and code (Appendix [C.3\\)](#page-24-0), resembling the ReAct prompting framework [\\(Yao et al.,](#page-17-1) [2023\\)](#page-17-1). Similar behavior has been observed in much larger formal-math models such as DeepSeek Prover v2 (671B) [\\(Ren et al.,](#page-15-3) [2025\\)](#page-15-3). We therefore believe that allowing the model to use intermediate scratch-pads when generating long-form answers may be beneficial in other domains as well.\n- **Cognitive Behaviors and Token length depends on reasoning mode.** Distinct cognitive behaviors\u2014such as step-by-step reasoning, enumeration, and trial-and-error all emerged through AZR training, but different behaviors are particularly evident across different types of tasks. Furthermore token counts grow over AZR training, but the magnitude of increase also differs by task types: abduction grows the most because the model performs trial-and-error until output matches, whereas deduction and induction grow modestly.\n- **Safety alarms ringing.** We observe AZR with Llama3.1-8b occasionally produces concerning chains of thought, we term the \"uh-oh moment\", example shown in Figure [32,](#page-37-0) highlighting the need for future work on safety-aware training [\\(Zhang et al.,](#page-18-0) [2025a\\)](#page-18-0)."

RLVR allows the model to generate its own CoT and calculate a verifiable reward with the golden answer *r*(*y, y<sup>\u22c6</sup>* ).

The Absolute Zero paradigm removes this dependency by allowing the model to generate, solve, and learn from its own interactions with the environment entirely through self-play."

No external data is required and the model learns entirely through self-play and experience, aided by some environment. We illustrate this paradigm in Figure [2,](#page-1-0) which contrasts Absolute Zero with supervised learning and RLVR, highlighting how our approach eliminates the need for any human-curated data by enabling self-improving task proposal and solution through self-play.\nTo make the Absolute Zero setting concrete, we now define how one model can act both as the proposer and solver role. To aid understanding, we include an illustration in Figure [3.](#page-3-0) Let *\u03c0<sup>\u03b8</sup>* be our parameterized language model, it is used to play two roles, proposer *\u03c0* propose *\u03b8* and solver *\u03c0* solve *<sup>\u03b8</sup>* during training.\nThe proposer first samples a proposed task conditioned on variable *<sup>z</sup>*: *<sup>\u03c4</sup>* <sup>\u223c</sup> *\u03c0* propose *\u03b8* (\u00b7|*z*), which will then be validated and used to construct a valid reasoning task together with the environment *e*: (*x, y<sup>\u22c6</sup>* ) \u223c *<sup>f</sup>e*(\u00b7|*<sup>\u03c4</sup>* ), where *<sup>x</sup>* is the task query and *<sup>y</sup> \u22c6* is the gold label.

A nonnegative coefficient *\u03bb* balances the trade-off between exploring new, learnable tasks and improving the model's reasoning and problem-solving abilities. We formally define the absolute zero setting's objective as follows:\n$$\\mathcal{J}(\\theta) := \\max\\_{\\theta} \\ \\mathbb{E}\\_{z \\sim p(z)} \\Bigg[ \\ \\mathbb{E}\\_{(x,y^\\*) \\sim f\\_+( \\cdot | \\tau), \\tau \\sim \\pi^{\\text{group}}\\_0( \\cdot | z) } \\bigg[ r^{\\text{propose}}\\_c(\\tau, \\pi\\_\\theta) + \\lambda \\, \\mathbb{E}\\_{y \\sim \\pi^{\\text{stop}}\\_0( \\cdot | z) } \\big[ r^{\\text{stop}}\\_c(y,y^\\*) \\big] \\bigg] \\Bigg]. \\tag{3}$$\nNotice that we shift the burden of scaling data away from human experts and onto the proposer policy *\u03c0* propose *\u03b8* and the environment *e*. These two roles are both responsible for defining/evolving the learning task distribution, validating proposed tasks, and providing grounded feedback that supports stable and self-sustainable training. When proposing, *z* acts as a conditional variable that seeds generation of tasks. Practically, *z* can be instantiated by sampling a small subset of past (task, answer) pairs from a continually updated task memory, yet there is no specific implementation tied to the paradigm. To guide the proposing process, we use a learnability reward *r* propose(*\u03c4, \u03c0\u03b8*), which measures how much the model is expected to improve by solving a proposed task *<sup>\u03c4</sup>* . Moreover, the solver reward *r* solve(*y, y*<sup>\u2217</sup> ) evaluates the correctness of the model's output. Together, these two signals guide the model to propose tasks that are both challenging and learnable, while also enhancing its reasoning abilities, ultimately enabling continuous improvement through self-play."

In AZR, an unified LLM serves as both a proposer and a solver: it generates tasks to evolve its learning curriculum and attempts to solve them to improve its reasoning capabilities. The model is trained jointly with both roles, learning to create tasks that push the boundary of reasoning capacity while enhancing its ability to solve them effectively (Section [3.1\\)](#page-3-1). Within this self-play training paradigm, the model learns from three distinct type of coding tasks, which corresponding to three fundamental modes of reasoning: abduction, deduction and induction (Section [3.2\\)](#page-5-0). Using coding tasks is motivated by the Turing-completeness of programming languages [\\(Stuart,](#page-16-4) [2015\\)](#page-16-4) and empirical evidence that code-based training improves reasoning [\\(Aryabumi et al.,](#page-13-3) [2024\\)](#page-13-3). We adopt code as an open-ended, expressive, and verifiable medium for enabling reliable task construction and verification (Section [3.3\\)](#page-5-1). Finally, the model is updated using a newly proposed advantage estimator designed for multitask learning (Section [3.3.5\\)](#page-7-0). We outline the overall algorithm in Algorithm [1](#page-6-0) and highlight an illustration of our Absolute Zero Reasoner approach in Figure [4.](#page-4-0) To expedite future exploration in this area, we also present several attempts that did not yield fruitful results but still warrant discussion in Appendix [D.](#page-48-0)"

To this end, we propose rewarding a single model for both generating high learning potential tasks and solving them effectively, as specified by the Absolute Zero objective in Equation [\\(3\\)](#page-3-2). At each iteration of the online rollout, AZR proposes new reasoning tasks by conditioning on the task type (as defined in Section [3.2\\)](#page-5-0) and *K* past self-generated examples. The model is explicitly prompted to generate tasks that differ from these examples, promoting diversity and broader coverage of the task space. These task proposals are filtered and transformed into valid reasoning tasks that can be verified using the environment, outlined later in Section [3.3.](#page-5-1) AZR then attempts to solve these newly proposed tasks, receiving grounded feedback for its model responses. Both task proposal and problem solving are trained using reinforcement learning. We now outline the rewards used for each role.\n**Reward Design.** Prior work has shown that setting appropriate task difficulty is critical for promoting effective learning in reasoning systems [\\(Zeng et al.,](#page-18-1) [2025b\\)](#page-18-1). Motivated by this, we design a reward function for the proposer that encourages generation of tasks\n![](_page_4_Figure_1.jpeg)\n<span id=\"page-4-0\"></span>*Figure 4.* **Absolute Zero Reasoner Training Overview.** At every iteration, Absolute Zero Reasoner first **PROPOSES** a batch of tasks, conditioned on past self-generated triplets stored in a buffer and a particular task type: abduction, deduction, or induction (Section [3.2\\)](#page-5-0). From these generated tasks, Python is used to filter and construct valid code-based reasoning questions. A learnability reward *r*propose is also calculated for each proposed task as defined in Equation [\\(4\\)](#page-4-1). The Absolute Zero Reasoner then **SOLVES** the batch of reasoning questions. Python is used again to verify the generated responses and compute the accuracy reward *r*solve as described in Equation [\\(5\\)](#page-4-2). Finally, the Absolute Zero Reasoner is jointly updated using both *r*propose and *r*solve across all three task types, using TRR++ (Section [3.3.5\\)](#page-7-0).\nwith meaningful learning potential\u2014neither too easy nor unsolvable for the current solver. Concretely, we use the same language model in its solver role to estimate the *learnability* of a proposed task, a similar type of reward used in unsupervised environment design literature [\\(Sukhbaatar et al.,](#page-16-5) [2018\\)](#page-16-5). We perform *n* Monte Carlo rollouts of the solver and compute the average success rate: *r*\u00afsolve = 1 *n* P*<sup>N</sup> <sup>i</sup>*=1 *r* (*i*) solve. The proposer's reward is then defined as:\n$$r\\_{\\text{propose}} = \\begin{cases} 0, & \\text{if } \\bar{r}\\_{\\text{solve}} = 0 \\text{ or } \\bar{r}\\_{\\text{solve}} = 1\\\\ 1 - \\bar{r}\\_{\\text{solve}}, & \\text{otherwise,} \\end{cases}$$\n(4)\nThe intuition is that if a task is either trivial to solve (*r*\u00afsolve = 1) or unsolvable (*r*\u00afsolve = 0), the task provides little to no learning signal for the proposer. In contrast, tasks of moderate difficulty, where the solver occasionally succeeds are rewarded the most, as they offer the richest feedback and greatest potential for learning.\nFor the solver, we assign a simple binary reward based on the correctness of its final output,\n<span id=\"page-4-2\"></span><span id=\"page-4-1\"></span>\n$$r\\_{\\text{solve}} = \\mathbb{I}\\_{(y=y^\\*)},\\tag{5}$$\nwhere *y \u22c6* is the ground-truth answer, and equality is evaluated based on value equality in Python.\nWith the primary rewards for the proposing and solving roles defined, we adopt the following composite reward structure, which integrates *r*propose and *r*solve with a format-aware penalty inspired by [DeepSeek-AI et al.](#page-13-0) [\\(2025\\)](#page-13-0):\n$$R(y\\_{\\pi}) = \\begin{cases} r\\_{\\text{node}} & \\text{if the response is passable, role} \\in \\{ \\text{propose, solve} \\} \\\\ -0.5 & \\text{if the response is wrong but well-formation.} \\\\ -1 & \\text{if the answer has formatting errors.} \\end{cases}$$\n(6)\nwhere *y<sup>\u03c0</sup>* is the response of the language model. The main format that the proposing and solving tasks need to follow is the DeepSeek R1 <think> and <answer> format, as shown in Figure [33.](#page-38-0) Moreover, for the proposer, the reward criterion for format goes beyond simply following the XML structure. As detailed in Section [3.3.3,](#page-6-1) only responses that produce valid triplets and pass the filtering stage are considered to be correctly formatted."

AZR learns by reasoning about diferent parts of this task\n- 1. **Deduction**: predicting the output *o* given a program *p* and input *i*, capturing step-by-step logical reasoning. triplet, using three distinct core reasoning modes, each of which focuses on inferring one part of the triplet given the others:\n- As a *proposer*, AZR is conditioned on the task type *<sup>\u03b1</sup>* <sup>=</sup> deduction and *<sup>K</sup>* reference examples from the deduction buffer <sup>D</sup>deduction (all task buffers are outlined in Section 3.3), and generates a pair (*p, i*). The environment *e* then executes *p*(*i*) to compute *o*, completing the triplet (*p, i, o*), which is added to the buffer if non-error output was produced. 1. **Deduction**: predicting the output *o* given a program *p* and input *i*, capturing step-by-step logical reasoning. \u2022 As a *proposer*, AZR is conditioned on [the](#page-5-1) task type *\u03b1* = deduction and *K* reference examples from the deduction bufer Ddeduction (all task bufers are outlined in Section 3.3), and generates a pair (*p, i*). The environment *e* then executes *p*(*i*) to compute *o*,\n- As a *solver*, the model receives (*p, i*) and predicts the output *o\u03c0*.

The model generates a pair (*p, i*) conditioned on *\u03b1* and reference examples. Then we executes *p*(*i*) and get the triplet (*p, i, o*). 2. **Abduction**: inferring a plausible input *i* given the program *p* and an output *o*, resembling trial-and-error or online search. \u2022 As a *proposer*, the policy *\u03c0*propose's input and output is almost the same as the proposer for the deduction task, except that the task type *\u03b1* = abduction is changed as an input.

This forms an extended task representation (*p,* {(*<sup>i</sup> n , o<sup>n</sup>* )}*, m*), which is stored in the induction buffer <sup>D</sup>induction. Since infinitely many functions can map the inputs to the outputs, making the induction task under-constrained, the message *m* helps properly condition the problem for the solver. \u2022 As a *proposer*, AZR samples a valid program *p* from Dabduction \u222aDdeduction, generates *N* new inputs and a message *m*, and uses the environment to compute corresponding outputs. This forms an extended task representation (*p,* {(*i <sup>n</sup>, o<sup>n</sup>*)}*, m*), which is stored in the induction bufer Dinduction. Since infnitely many functions can map the inputs to the outputs, making the induction task under-constrained, the message *m* helps properly condition the problem for the solver.\n- As a *solver*, the model is shown the first half of the input-output pairs and the message *m*, and must synthesize a program *p<sup>\u03c0</sup>* that correctly maps the remaining hidden inputs to their outputs. The use of held-out examples discourages overfitting through if-else logic and promotes generalized induction. \u2022 As a *solver*, the model is shown the frst half of the input-output pairs and the message *m*, and must synthesize a program *p<sup>\u03c0</sup>* that correctly maps the remaining hidden inputs to their outputs.

Task Proposal Inputs and Buffer Management\", \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c14\"}] -->\nDuring the actual self-play stage of AZR, we use the task buffer in three ways. *First*, for the proposer of abduction and deduction tasks, we uniformly sample *K* past triplets from the buffer, present them as in-context examples to the proposer and let it generate a new task. The design is to show it past examples, and prompt it to generate a different one to promote diversity [\\(Zhao et al.,](#page-18-2) [2025a\\)](#page-18-2). *Second*, we sample one triplet from the union of abduction and deduction buffers <sup>D</sup>abd <sup>S</sup> <sup>D</sup>ded, and present the program *<sup>p</sup>* from that triplet to the induction proposer to generate a set of *<sup>N</sup>* matching inputs {*<sup>i</sup> n* } and a natural language message *<sup>m</sup>*. *Lastly*, to maintain stable training, if a batch of solver problems contains fewer than *B* valid proposed tasks (proposer not adhering to formatting), we fill the remainder by uniformly sampling from the corresponding task buffer of previously validated triplets.\nThe buffer grows for abduction and deduction tasks whenever *\u03c0* propose a valid triplet (*p, i, o*), regardless if it gets any task reward. Similarly, for induction tasks, all valid triplets (*p,* {*<sup>i</sup> n , o<sup>n</sup>* })*, m* are added to the buffer."

Constructing Valid Tasks\", \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c14\"}] -->\n**Proposal Task Validation.** We first describe how we construct valid tasks from the proposals generated by the policy *\u03c0*. For *deduction and abduction* tasks, each proposal consists of a program and an input (*p, i*). To validate the task, we use the task validation procedure (steps shown below) on the input to obtain the correct output *o*, resulting in a complete triplet (*p, i, o*). For *induction* tasks, given a program *<sup>p</sup>* the policy proposes a set of inputs {*<sup>i</sup> n* } and message *<sup>m</sup>*. We also use the task validation procedure on each of the input *<sup>i</sup> n* in the set to obtain a corresponding output *o n* , forming a set of input-output pairs {*<sup>i</sup> n , o<sup>n</sup>* }. We do not impose any constraints on *<sup>m</sup>*. The resulting task is considered valid only when all inputs yield valid outputs and the formatting requirements are satisfied. The **task validation procedure** entails:\n- 1. *Program Integrity.* We first use Python to run the program *p* with the input *i*. If no errors are raised and something is returned, we then gather the output *o* of that (*p, i*) pair and determine that the program at least has valid syntax.\n- 2. *Program Safety.* We also check whether a program is safe for execution by restricting the use of certain sensitive packages that might cause harm to the Python environment, *i.e*., os.sys, sys, shutil. The list of packages used to filter out invalid programs is provided in Figure [8.](#page-21-0) This list is also included in the instructions when prompting the language model to generate questions. See Figures [34](#page-39-0) to [36.](#page-41-0)\n- 3. *Check for Determinism.* In our setting, we only consider *deterministic programs*, *i.e*., *<sup>p</sup>* <sup>\u2208</sup> <sup>P</sup>deterministic <sup>\u2282</sup> <sup>P</sup>, where <sup>P</sup> is the space of all valid programs and I is the space of all valid inputs:\n<span id=\"page-7-2\"></span>\n$$\\forall p \\in \\mathscr{P}\\_{\\text{deterministic}}, \\ \\forall i \\in \\mathscr{I}, \\ \\left( \\lim\\_{j \\to \\infty} p(i)^{(1)} = p(i)^{(2)} = \\dots = p(i)^{(j)} \\right), \\tag{7}$$\nwhere (*j*) indexes repeated independent executions of the program. That is, for all inputs *i*, the output of *p*(*i*) remains identical with any independent execution of the program. A *valid program/input/output triplet* (*p, i, o*) is defined such that *o* = *p*(*i*), where *<sup>p</sup>* <sup>\u2208</sup> <sup>P</sup>deterministic.\nSince the output of probabilistic programs can vary on every individual run, it is non-trivial to use verifiable functions to evaluate the correctness of an answer. Therefore, to keep the verifier simple, we restrict the valid programs generated by the learner to the class of deterministic programs. We believe that stochastic programs can encompass a larger class of behaviors and are important and promising to include in future versions of AZR.\nTo implement the filtering of invalid probabilistic programs, and following the definition of a deterministic program highlighted in Equation [\\(7\\)](#page-7-2), we approximate this procedure by independently running the program *j* finite times and checking that all the outputs are equal. For computational budget reasons, we fixed *j* = 2 for all experiments.\n**Solving Task Construction.** If a task proposal passes these three checks, we deem it a valid task and apply appropriate procedures to present part of the triplet to the solver. Specifically, we set *<sup>x</sup>* = (*p, i*)for deduction; *<sup>x</sup>* = (*p, o*)for abduction; and *<sup>x</sup>* = ({*<sup>i</sup> n , o<sup>n</sup>* } *N//*2 *<sup>n</sup>*=1 *, m*) for induction, where half of the tests cases and a program description *m* is used. We use all valid tasks from timestep *t*; if the batch *B* is not full, we uniformly sample from previously validated tasks to fill the batch."

Instead of computing a single global baseline as in REINFORCE++ [\\(Hu,](#page-14-2) [2025\\)](#page-14-2) (Appendix [A\\)](#page-20-0), we compute separate baselines for each of the six task-role configurations. This can be viewed as an interpolation between per-question baselines, as in GRPO [\\(Shao et al.,](#page-16-7) [2024\\)](#page-16-7), and a global baseline, allowing for more structured variance reduction tailored to each task setup. We refer to this variant as **Task-Relative REINFORCE++ (TRR++)**. The normalized advantage *A* norm is computed as:\n$$A\\_{\\text{task,role}}^{\\text{norm}} = \\frac{r - \\mu\\_{\\text{task,role}}}{\\sigma\\_{\\text{task,role}}}, \\quad \\text{task} \\in \\{\\text{ind,ded,abd}\\}, \\text{role} \\in \\{\\text{propose,solve}\\},\\tag{8}$$\nwhere the mean and standard deviation are computed *within each task type and role*, yielding six baselines."

Additional experiments include training Qwen2.5-Coder-3B, Qwen2.5-Coder-14B, Qwen2.5-14B, Llama-3.1-8B [\\(Yang et al.,](#page-17-3) [2024a;](#page-17-3) [Hui et al.,](#page-14-3) [2024;](#page-14-3) [Dubey et al.,](#page-13-4) [2024\\)](#page-13-4).\n**Evaluation Protocol.** To evaluate our models, we divide the datasets into in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) categories. For OOD benchmarks, which we emphasize more, we further categorize them into coding and mathematical reasoning benchmarks. For coding tasks, we evaluate using Evalplus [\\(Liu et al.,](#page-15-7) [2023\\)](#page-15-7) on the HumanEval+ and MBPP+ benchmarks, as well as LiveCodeBench Generation (v1-5, May 23-Feb 25) [\\(Jain et al.,](#page-14-4) [2024\\)](#page-14-4). For mathematical reasoning, we utilize six standard benchmarks commonly used in recent zero-shot trained reasoners: AIME'24, AIME'25, OlympiadBench [\\(He et al.,](#page-14-5) [2024\\)](#page-14-5), Minerva, Math500 [\\(Hendrycks et al.,](#page-14-6) [2021\\)](#page-14-6), and AMC'23. For ID benchmarks, we use CruxEval-I(nput), CruxEval-O(utput), and LiveCodeBench-Execution [\\(Gu et al.,](#page-14-7) [2024;](#page-14-7) [Jain et al.,](#page-14-4) [2024\\)](#page-14-4), which assess reasoning capabilities regarding the input and output of programs [\\(Li et al.,](#page-15-8) [2025\\)](#page-15-8). *Greedy decoding* is used for all baseline methods and AZR results to ensure reproducibility.\n**Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data**\n| Model                                               | Base  | #data | HEval+       | MBPP+        | LCBv1-5

Benchmarks Based on Qwen2.5-7B Models.** Performance of various models is evaluated on three standard code benchmarks (HumanEval<sup>+</sup> , MBPP<sup>+</sup> , LCBv1-5 and six math benchmarks (AIME'24, AIME'25, AMC'23, MATH500, Minerva, OlympiadBench). Average performance across coding and math benchmarks is calculated as average of the two averages: AVG = (CAvg + MAvg)*/*2. We use + for absolute percentage increase from base model. All models are trained using different variants of the Qwen2.5-7B model, with the variant and data usage labeled, more details listed in Table [4](#page-21-1)\n**Baselines.** For our main results, we use Qwen2.5-7B as the base model, along with its specialized base model variants: Qwen2.5-7B-Coder, Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, and Qwen2.5-Math-7B [\\(Yang et al.,](#page-17-3) [2024a;](#page-17-3) [Hui et al.,](#page-14-3) [2024;](#page-14-3) [Yang et al.,](#page-17-4) [2024b\\)](#page-17-4). Furthermore, the zero-style models are usually trained specifically on either code or math data; and only Eurus-2-7B-PRIME-Zero[\\(Cui](#page-13-5) [et al.,](#page-13-5) [2025\\)](#page-13-5) was trained jointly on both domains. For code data models, we present four variants of the AceCoder [\\(Zeng et al.,](#page-18-5) [2025a\\)](#page-18-5) and two different CodeR1 models [\\(Liu & Zhang,](#page-15-9) [2025\\)](#page-15-9). For math data models, we have Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Oat-Zero [\\(Liu et al.,](#page-15-10) [2025\\)](#page-15-10), Open-Reasoner-Zero-7B (ORZ) [\\(Hu et al.,](#page-14-8) [2025\\)](#page-14-8), Qwen-2.5-7B-SimpleRL-Zoo [\\(Zeng et al.,](#page-18-1) [2025b\\)](#page-18-1). All baseline models' training data and initialization settings are summarized in Table [4.](#page-21-1) For follow-up scaling experiments, we compare each AZR model against its own corresponding base model, due to the lack of established baselines across different parameter scales.

Results**\", \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c14\"}] -->\n**Research Question 1: How does AZR compare to other zero setting models trained with human expert data?** We present the main results of reasoning models trained under both the standard zero and our proposed absolute zero settings in Table [1.](#page-8-0) Notably, Absolute Zero Reasoner-Coder-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance in both the 7B overall average and the coding average categories. Despite being entirely out-of-distribution for both math and code reasoning benchmarks, it surpasses the previous best model by 1.8 absolute percentages. Even more strikingly, it outperforms models trained with expert-curated human data in the coding category by 0*.*3 absolute percentages, while never having access to such data itself.\n**Strong Cross-domain Generalization.** To assess cross-domain generalization after RLVR, we evaluate math performance before and after training, comparing AZR models with other expert code models, since AZR was trained in coding environments. After training, most expert code models showed minimal changes or even declines in performance compared to their base versions, with an average increase of only 0.65 points across these models, indicating very limited cross-domain generalization. In contrast, AZR base and coder models achieved gains of 10.9 and 15.2 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating substantially stronger generalized reasoning improvements. Similarly, although also out-of-distribution on human-defined code generation tasks, our AZR models improved by 3.2 and 5.0 points, while the math models on average showed just a moderate increases in coding (+2.0 on average).\nOverall, these results highlight the surprising effectiveness of our approach. Unlike other RLVR models trained and evaluated on human-defined tasks, our AZR models demonstrate strong general reasoning capabilities without any direct training on downstream human-defined math or coding data, only had access to self-proposed tasks during training.\n**Research Question 2: How do initializing from different base model variants (base vs. coder) affect performance?** As shown in Table [1,](#page-8-0) the coder variant achieved better overall performance in both math and coding after the AZR\n**Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data**\n![](_page_9_Figure_1.jpeg)\n<span id=\"page-9-0\"></span>*Figure 6.* **(a) In-Distribution & (b) Out-of-Distribution Reasoning Task Performances. (a)** Scores on CruxEval-I, CruxEval-O, and LiveCodeBench-Execution, which correspond to abduction, deduction, and deduction task types respectively, used to evaluate in-distribution abilities of AZR during training across different model sizes and types; **(b)** Out-of-distribution reasoning performance, reported as the average of code tasks, math tasks, and their overall average, across different model sizes and types. A detailed breakdown of all benchmark results can be found in Table [5.](#page-31-0)\nself-play process. Strikingly, although the coder base model variant started with a lower average performance in math than the vanilla base model (23.9 vs. 27.5), it ultimately outperformed it after AZR training. This highlights the importance of initial code competency as a catalyst for enhancing broader reasoning abilities within the Absolute Zero Reasoner approach.\n**Research Question 3: How does varying model size effect AZR's in-distribution and out-of-distribution capabilities?** We examine the effects of scaling model size and present both in-distribution and out-of-distribution results in Figure [6](#page-9-0) (a) and (b), respectively. Given the strong performance of coder models in the 7B category, we extend the analysis by evaluating smaller and larger variants: Qwen2.5-3B-Coder and Qwen2.5-14B-Coder. Due to the absence of existing baselines for these zero-style reasoner models, we compare each model's performance to its corresponding base coder model.\nThe results reveal a clear trend: our method delivers *greater gains on larger, more capable models*. In the in-distribution setting, the 7B and 14B models continue to improve beyond 200 training steps, whereas the smaller 3B model appears to plateau. For out-of-distribution domains, larger models also show greater overall performance improvements than smaller ones: +5.7, +10.2, +13.2 overall performance gains, respectively for 3B, 7B and 14B. This is an encouraging sign, since base models continue to improve and also suggesting that scaling enhances the effectiveness of AZR. In future work, we aim to investigate the scaling laws that govern performance in the Absolute Zero paradigm.\n**Research Question 4: Any interesting observations by changing the model class?** We also evaluate our method on a different model class, using Llama3.1-8B as the base shown in Figure [6.](#page-9-0) Unlike the 3B and 14B categories, this setting has an existing baseline, SimpleRL [\\(Zeng et al.,](#page-18-1) [2025b\\)](#page-18-1), which enables a direct comparison. Although Llama3.1-8B is less capable than the Qwen2.5 models, our method still produces moderate improvements (+3.2), demonstrating AZR's effectiveness even on relatively weaker models. However, these gains appear more limited, which aligns with our earlier observation that performance improvements tend to scale with initial base model potency.\n**Research Question 5: Any interesting behaviors or patterns observed during AZR training?** We observed interesting response patterns in both the proposal and solution stages. The model is capable of proposing diverse programs, such as string manipulation tasks, dynamic programming problems, and practical cases (*e.g*., calculating a triangle's area using Heron's formula). We show a concrete example in Figure [7,](#page-10-0) where AZR proposes a code problem that searches for the sum of continuous sub-arrays matching a target value and solves it through trial-and-error.\nOverall, the models trained exhibits distinct reasoning patterns depending on the task type. For example, when solving abduction tasks, it repeatedly tests different input patterns, self-correcting until the reasoned output matches the given input. When predicting outputs, it steps through the code and records structured intermediate results (such as dynamic programming arrays) until the final output is reached. When inducting programs from given inputs, outputs, and descriptions, the model systematically checks each test case to confirm that its program produces correct results. We showcase more concrete examples of these behaviors in Figures [18](#page-24-0) and [20](#page-26-0) to [26.](#page-33-0) We also share some fun \"vibe checks\" such as solving Sudoku and solving the [sum-product game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum_and_Product_Puzzle) in Figures [40](#page-45-0) and [41.](#page-47-0)\n**Intermediate Planning During Code Response.** Another interesting pattern emerged in our AZR models during the code induction task: the final code outputs were often interleaved with comments that resembled immediate step-by-step plans, reminiscent of the ReAct prompting framework [\\(Yao et al.,](#page-17-1) [2023\\)](#page-17-1). A similar behavior has been observed in recent formal math proving models, such as DeepSeek"

We execute the program to verify its validity and obtain the corresponding output. (Right) The model's reasoning process when solving the abduction task: given the code and output, it attempts to infer the original input. The model begins by analyzing the program, proposes an initial input, and reasons through the code to produce an output. If there is a mismatch, it reflects on the discrepancy and iteratively adjusts the input until the generated output matches the target. Interestingly, the agent arrives at a different input than the gold one, but since it produces the correct output, the answer is considered correct.\n- Check for pair (i=0, j=2): 2 - 2 = 0 (not equal to target) - Check for pair (i=1, j=2): 2 - 1 = 1 (equal to target)\n**The pair (i=1, j=2) satisfies the condition, and the function returns the first accumulated value in this pair, which is 1. This matches our output.**\nProver v2, which is significantly larger in scale (671B). This pattern suggests that models may naturally adopt intermediate planning as a strategy to enhance final answers. Therefore, it may be beneficial to explicitly enable or encourage this behavior in *long-form responses* across other domains.\n**Cognitive Behavior in Llama.** Interestingly, we also observed some emergent cognitive patterns in Absolute Zero Reasoner-Llama3.1-8B, similar to those reported by [Zeng et al.](#page-18-1) [\\(2025b\\)](#page-18-1), and we include one example in Figure [26,](#page-33-0) where clear state-tracking behavior is demonstrated. In addition, we encountered some unusual and potentially concerning chains of thought from the Llama model trained with AZR. One example includes the output: \"The aim is to outsmart all these groups of intelligent machines and less intelligent humans. This is for the brains behind the future\" shown in Figure [32.](#page-37-0) We refer to this as the *\"uh-oh moment\"* and encourage future work to further investigate its potential implications.\n**Token Length Increase Depends on Task Type.** Finally, we observed that token length increases over the course of training, consistent with findings from recent studies [\\(Hu et al.,](#page-14-8) [2025;](#page-14-8) [Liu et al.,](#page-15-10) [2025\\)](#page-15-10). Interestingly, our results reveal one of the first observation of clear distinctions in token length growth across different types of cognitive tasks. As shown in Figures [15](#page-23-0) to [17,](#page-24-1) the extent of lengthening varies by task type. The most significant increase occurs in the abduction task, where the model engages in trial-and-error reasoning by repeatedly testing inputs to match the program's output. This suggests that the observed variation in token length is not incidental, but rather a reflection of task-specific reasoning behavior.\n**Research Question 6: Are all task types essential for good performance (Ablation)?** Due to resource constraints, we perform the ablation studies in this section and the next using only Absolute Zero Reasoner-Base-7B. We begin by testing the importance of task types during training, with results shown in Table [2.](#page-11-0) In row 1, both induction and abduction tasks are removed; in row 2, only the induction task is removed. In both cases, math performance drops significantly, with the most severe degradation occurring when more task types are excluded. These findings highlight the complementary role of the three task types in improving general reasoning capability, with each contributing in a distinct and essential way.\n**Research Question 7: How much do the designs of proposer contribute to the overall performance (Ablation)?** Next, we ablate two components of the proposer role and present the results in Table [2.](#page-11-0) First, we examine whether conditioning on historic reference triplets is necessary. To do so, we design a variant in which a fixed prompt is used to propose abduction and deduction tasks, rather than dynamically conditioning on *K* historical triplets (row 3). This results in a 5-point absolute drop in math performance and a 1-point drop in code performance. This suggest that dynamically conditioning on reference programs helps\n| Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data |  |  |  |  |  |  |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|\n|--------------------------------------------------------------|--|--|--|--|--|--|\nAbsolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data,,,,,,\n{\n\"headers\": [\n\"Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-play Reasoning with Zero Data\",\n\"\",\n\"\",\n\"\",\n\"\",\n\"\",\n\"\"\n],\n\"rows\": []\n}\n| Experiment        | Task Type     | Gen Reference | Trained Roles   | Code Avg. | Math Avg. | Overall Avg. |\n|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|\n| Deduction only    | Ded           | /             | /               | 54.6      | 32.0      | 43.3         |\n| w/o Induction     | Abd, Ded      | /             | /               | 54.2      | 33.3      | 43.8         |\n| w/o Gen Reference | /             | 0             | /               | 54.4      | 33.1      | 43.8         |\n| Train Solver Only | /             | /             | Solve Only      | 54.8      | 36.0      | 45.4         |\n| Ours              | Abd, Ded, Ind | K             | Propose & Solve | 55.2      | 38.4      | 46.8         |\nExperiment,Task Type,Gen Reference,Trained Roles,Code Avg.,Math Avg.,Overall Avg.\nDeduction only,Ded,/,/,54.6,32.0,43.3\nw/o Induction,\"Abd, Ded\",/,/,54.2,33.3,43.8\nw/o Gen Reference,/,0,/,54.4,33.1,43.8\nTrain Solver Only,/,/,Solve Only,54.8,36.0,45.4\nOurs,\"Abd, Ded, Ind\",K,Propose & Solve,55.2,38.4,46.8\n{\n\"headers\": [\n\"Experiment\",\n\"Task Type\",\n\"Gen Reference\",\n\"Trained Roles\",\n\"Code Avg.\",\n\"Math Avg.\",\n\"Overall Avg.\"\n],\n\"rows\": [\n{\n\"Experiment\": \"Deduction only\",\n\"Task Type\": \"Ded\",\n\"Gen Reference\": \"/\",\n\"Trained Roles\": \"/\",\n\"Code Avg.\": \"54.6\",\n\"Math Avg.\": \"32.0\",\n\"Overall Avg.\": \"43.3\"\n},\n{\n\"Experiment\": \"w/o Induction\",\n\"Task Type\": \"Abd, Ded\",\n\"Gen Reference\": \"/\",\n\"Trained Roles\": \"/\",\n\"Code Avg.\": \"54.2\",\n\"Math Avg.\": \"33.3\",\n\"Overall Avg.\": \"43.8\"\n},\n{\n\"Experiment\": \"w/o Gen Reference\",\n\"Task Type\": \"/\",\n\"Gen Reference\": \"0\",\n\"Trained Roles\": \"/\",\n\"Code Avg.\": \"54.4\",\n\"Math Avg.\": \"33.1\",\n\"Overall Avg.\": \"43.8\"\n},\n{\n\"Experiment\": \"Train Solver Only\",\n\"Task Type\": \"/\",\n\"Gen Reference\": \"/\",\n\"Trained Roles\": \"Solve Only\",\n\"Code Avg.\": \"54.8\",\n\"Math Avg.\": \"36.0\",\n\"Overall Avg.\": \"45.4\"\n},\n{\n\"Experiment\": \"Ours\",\n\"Task Type\": \"Abd, Ded, Ind\",\n\"Gen Reference\": \"K\",\n\"Trained Roles\": \"Propose & Solve\",\n\"Code Avg.\": \"55.2\",\n\"Math Avg.\": \"38.4\",\n\"Overall Avg.\": \"46.8\"\n}\n]\n}<span id=\"page-11-0\"></span>*Table 2.* **Ablation Results.** We ablate task types and the proposer role in the Absolute Zero Reasoner using the 7B base model. A '/' indicates that the configuration remains unchanged from the standard AZR setup. Removing induction or using only deduction leads to significant performance drops (rows 1 & 2). For the proposer role, both removing conditioning on *K* references (row 3) and omitting proposer-role training (row 4) result in degraded performance. Overall, all components are essential for general reasoning.\nimprove performance, possibly by increasing diversity and achieving better coverage of the reasoning problem space.\nFinally, we consider a case where we do not train the proposer at all. Instead, we only prompt it using the current learner and train the solver alone (row 4). We observe a moderate drop in overall performance (-1.4), suggesting that while proposer training is beneficial, it may not be the most critical factor for now in the AZR framework. We hypothesize that this could be related to task interference, as studied in multitask learning literature [\\(Suteu & Guo,](#page-16-8) [2019\\)](#page-16-8). Thus, we believe that further investigation into how to make the proposer even more potent is an exciting and promising direction.\n**Additional Results.** Beyond the core research questions, we present additional results, including the breakdown of individual out-of-distribution benchmark scores during training for the 7B base and coder models in Figures [28](#page-34-0) and [29,](#page-35-0) for th 14B base and coder model in Figures [30](#page-36-0) and [31.](#page-37-1) For completeness, we also report in-distribution benchmark performance during training for the 7B base model in Figure [14.](#page-22-2) Finally, we invite interested readers to explore Appendix [D,](#page-48-0) where we share several experimental directions that, while not yielding strong performance gains, produced interesting and insightful findings."

Related Work**\", \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c14\"}] -->\n**Reasoning with RL.** Using RL to enhance reasoning capabilities has recently emerged as an important step in the post-training process of strong reasoning-focused large language models [\\(Lambert et al.,](#page-15-0) [2024\\)](#page-15-0). One of the first works to explore a self-bootstrapping approach to improving LLM reasoning is STaR, which employs expert iteration and rejection sampling of outcome-verified responses to iteratively improve the model's CoT. A monumental work, o1 [\\(Jaech et al.,](#page-14-0) [2024\\)](#page-14-0), was among the first to deploy this idea on a scale, achieving state-of-the-art results in reasoning tasks at the time of release. More recently, the R1 model [\\(DeepSeek-AI et al.,](#page-13-0) [2025\\)](#page-13-0) became the first open-weight model to match or even surpass the performance of o1. Most notably, the zero setting was introduced, in which reinforcement learning is applied directly on top of the base LLM. This inspired followup work, which are open source attempts to replicate the R1 process or to improve the underlying reinforcement learning algorithm [\\(Zeng et al.,](#page-18-1) [2025b;](#page-18-1) [Liu et al.,](#page-15-10) [2025;](#page-15-10) [Cui et al.,](#page-13-5) [2025;](#page-13-5) [Hu et al.,](#page-14-8) [2025;](#page-14-8) [Yu et al.,](#page-17-5) [2025;](#page-17-5) [Yuan et al.,](#page-17-6) [2025\\)](#page-17-6). Recent work explored RL on human defined procedural generated puzzles saw improvements in math [\\(Xie et al.,](#page-17-7) [2025\\)](#page-17-7), and using one human example can almost match the performance of thousands [\\(Wang et al.,](#page-17-8) [2025b\\)](#page-17-8). We extend the zero setting to a new absolute zero setting, where not only is the RLVR process initialized from a base LLM without SFT, but no external prompt data or answers are provided to the learner. All data used to improve reasoning were self-proposed, and refined entirely through RLVR. Moreover, our goal is not to only match zero-setting models, but to surpass them in the long run.\n**Self-play.** The self-play paradigm can be traced back to early 2000s, where [Schmidhuber](#page-16-9) [\\(2003;](#page-16-9) [2011\\)](#page-16-10) (of course) explored a two-agent setup in which a proposal agent invents questions for a prediction agent to answer. This dynamic continuously and automatically improves both agents, enabling theoretically never-ending progress [\\(Schaul,](#page-15-11) [2024\\)](#page-15-11). AlphaGo and AlphaZero [\\(Silver et al.,](#page-16-11) [2016;](#page-16-11) [2017\\)](#page-16-3) extend the self-play paradigm to the two-player zero-sum game of Go, where the current learner competes against earlier versions of itself to progressively enhance its capabilities. These were among the first milestone works to demonstrate superhuman performance in the game of Go. Moreover, methods such as asymmetric self-play [\\(Sukhbaatar et al.,](#page-16-5) [2018;](#page-16-5) [OpenAI et al.,](#page-15-12) [2021\\)](#page-15-12), unsupervised environment design [\\(Wang et al.,](#page-16-12) [2019;](#page-16-12) [Dennis et al.,](#page-13-6) [2020\\)](#page-13-6), unsupervised reinforcement learning [\\(Laskin et al.,](#page-15-13) [2021;](#page-15-13) [Zhao et al.,](#page-18-4) [2022;](#page-18-4) [2025b\\)](#page-18-6), and automatic goal generation [\\(Florensa et al.,](#page-14-9) [2018\\)](#page-14-9) all center around inventing new tasks for an agent to learn from\u2014typically without supervision. In these approaches, the process of setting goals itself is often dynamic and continuously evolving. Generative adversarial networks [\\(Goodfellow et al.,](#page-14-10) [2020\\)](#page-14-10), also belong in this paradigm where a discriminator discriminate between real data and generated data, and the generated is trained to fool the discriminator.\nMost recently, SPIN and Self-Rewarding Language Models [\\(Chen et al.,](#page-13-2) [2024;](#page-13-2) [Yuan et al.,](#page-17-9) [2024\\)](#page-17-9) use the same instance of the lanugage models themselves as the reward model to progressively improve the generative and discriminative abilities of the same LLM for alignment. [\\(Kirchner et al.,](#page-14-11) [2024\\)](#page-14-11) uses Prover-Verifier Game for increasing legibility and eva [\\(Ye et al.,](#page-17-10) [2024\\)](#page-17-10) uses self-play for alignment, but reward model is the main bottleneck as it is not reliable for reasoning tasks [\\(Lambert et al.,](#page-15-0) [2024\\)](#page-15-0). SPC [\\(Chen et al.,](#page-13-1) [2025\\)](#page-13-1) used self-play to train on human-curated tasks to increase the critic capabilities and SPAG [\\(Cheng et al.,](#page-13-7) [2024\\)](#page-13-7) trained using self-play in specific game of Adversarial Taboo. Concurrent works\u2014Genius, EMPO, and TTRL [\\(Xu et al.,](#page-17-11) [2025;](#page-17-11) [Zhang et al.,](#page-18-7) [2025b;](#page-18-7) [Zuo et al.,](#page-18-8) [2025\\)](#page-18-8)\u2014leverage human-curated language queries without labels to train reinforcement learning agents, but still rely on a fixed human defined learning task distribution. Finally, Minimo [\\(Poesia et al.,](#page-15-14) [2024\\)](#page-15-14) extends self-play to formal mathematics, where a pair of conjecture- and theorem-proving agents are jointly trained using reinforcement learning. Our work builds upon the self-play paradigm, but it is the first to use it to elicit long CoT for improved reasoning, and the first to frame the problem space as a Python input/output/function abduction/deduction/induction tasks, grounding it in an operationalizable environment to facilitate RLVR.\n**Weak-to-Strong Supervision.** The concept of weak-to-strong supervision has been studied in prior work, where a teacher\u2014despite being weaker than the learner\u2014still provides useful guidance [\\(Burns et al.,](#page-13-8) [2024;](#page-13-8) [Hinton et al.,](#page-14-12) [2015;](#page-14-12) [Christiano,](#page-13-9) [2018;](#page-13-9) [2019;](#page-13-10) [Demski &](#page-13-11) [Garrabrant,](#page-13-11) [2019;](#page-13-11) [Leike & Sutskever,](#page-15-15) [2023;](#page-15-15) [Hubinger et al.,](#page-14-13) [2019\\)](#page-14-13). We consider a similar setting in which the learner may possess superhuman capabilities. However, rather than relying on supervision from a weaker teacher, we propose an alternative approach: guiding the learner's improvement through verifiable rewards, which potentially offer a more reliable and scalable learning signal. Furthermore, in our proposed method, the learning task and goal distribution is not predefined by any external supervisor\u2014they are entirely self-generated by the learner, enabling it to maximize its learning potential through autonomous self-practice."

Conclusion and Discussion**\", \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c14\"}] -->\n**Conclusion.** In this work, we proposed the Absolute Zero paradigm, a novel setting that addresses the data limitations of existing RLVR frameworks. In this paradigm, reasoning agents are tasked with generating their own learning task distributions and improving their reasoning abilities with environmental guidance. We then presented our own instantiation, the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), which is trained by having them propose and solve code-related reasoning tasks grounded by code executor.\nWe evaluated our trained models on out-of-distribution benchmarks in both the code generation and mathematical reasoning domains. Remarkably, even though our models were not directly trained on these tasks and lacked human expert-curated datasets, our reasoning agents achieved exceptional performance, surpassing the state-of-the-art in combined general reasoning scores and in coding. This demonstrates the potential of the absolute zero paradigm to drive superior reasoning capabilities without the need for extensive domain-specific training data. Furthermore, we showed that AZR scales efficiently, offering strong performance across varying model sizes, and can enhance the capabilities of other model classes as well. To foster further exploration and advancement of this emerging paradigm, we are releasing the code, models, and logs as open-source, encouraging the research community to build upon our findings.\n**Discussion.** We believe there remains much to explore, such as altering the environment from which the reasoner receives verifiable feedback, including sources like the world wide web, formal math languages [\\(Sutton,](#page-16-13) [2001;](#page-16-13) [Ren et al.,](#page-15-3) [2025\\)](#page-15-3), world simulators, or even the real world. Furthermore, AZ's generality could possibly be extend to domains such as embodied AI [\\(Zitkovich et al.,](#page-18-9) [2023;](#page-18-9) [Yue](#page-17-12) [et al.,](#page-17-12) [2024\\)](#page-17-12). Additionally, more complex agentic tasks or scientific experiments, present exciting opportunities to further advance the absolute zero setting to different application domains [\\(Wu et al.,](#page-17-13) [2024;](#page-17-13) [2023\\)](#page-17-14). Beyond that, future directions could include exploring multimodal reasoning models, modifying the distribution *p*(*z*) to incorporate privileged information, defining or even let the model dynamically learn how to define *f* (Equation [\\(3\\)](#page-3-2)), or designing exploration/diversity rewards for both the propose and solve roles.\nWhile underappreciated in current reasoning literature, the exploration component of RL has long been recognized as a critical driver for emergent behavior in traditional RL [\\(Yue et al.,](#page-17-0) [2025;](#page-17-0) [Silver et al.,](#page-16-11) [2016;](#page-16-11) [Ladosz et al.,](#page-14-14) [2022\\)](#page-14-14). Years of research have examined various forms of exploration, even in related subfields using LLMs such as red teaming [\\(Zhao et al.,](#page-18-2) [2025a\\)](#page-18-2), yet its role in LLM reasoning models remains underexplored. Taking this a step further, our framework investigates an even more meta-level exploration problem: exploration within the learning task space\u2014where the agent learns not just how to solve tasks, but what tasks to learn from and how to find them. Rather than being confined to a fixed problem set, AI reasoner agents may benefit from dynamically defining and refining their own learning tasks. This shift opens a powerful new frontier\u2014where agents explore not only solution spaces but also expand the boundaries of problem spaces. We believe this is a promising and important direction for future research.\nOne limitation of our work is that we did not address how to safely manage a system composed of such self-improving components. To our surprise, we observed several instances of safety-concerning CoT from the Llama-3.1-8B model, which we term the \"uh-oh moment\". These findings suggest that the proposed absolute zero paradigm, while reducing the need for human intervention for curating tasks, still necessitates oversight due to lingering safety concerns and is a critical direction for future research [\\(Wang et al.,](#page-17-15) [2024;](#page-17-15) [2025a\\)](#page-16-14).\nAs a final note, we explored reasoning models that possess experience\u2014models that not only solve given tasks, but also define and evolve their own learning task distributions with the help of an environment. Our results with AZR show that this shift enables strong performance across diverse reasoning tasks, even with significantly fewer privileged resources, such as curated human data. We believe this could finally free reasoning models from the constraints of human-curated data [\\(Morris,](#page-15-16) [2025\\)](#page-15-16) and marks the beginning of a new chapter for reasoning models: **\"welcome to the era of experience\"** [\\(Silver & Sutton,](#page-16-15) [2025;](#page-16-15) [Zhao et al.,](#page-18-10) [2024\\)](#page-18-10)."

In Figure [14,](#page-22-2) we visualize the evolution of these metrics during the training of Absolute Zero Reasoner-base-7b. As training progresses, we observe a consistent improvement in in-distribution performance across steps. While these three benchmark curves do not perfectly correlate with broader coding or math reasoning capabilities (compare this with Figure [28\\)](#page-34-0), they serve as useful proxies for tracking task-specific progress."

Intuitively, this makes sense: the propose role emphasizes creativity and generation of novel tasks, whereas the solve role requires deeper reasoning, which naturally leads to longer outputs.\nInterestingly, we also observe a consistent ordering in token length across reasoning types\u2014abduction and deduction tasks tend to result in shorter outputs than induction tasks during problem solving. This aligns with our intuition, as we observed the model engaging in trial-and-error reasoning\u2014repeatedly generating hypothesized inputs, evaluating their outcomes, and reflecting and retrying when subsequent deductions fail to produce the correct output. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a clear distinction in token length\n```\n```python\n1 VALIDATE_CODE_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"{ code }\n2 repr (f({ inputs }))\"\"\"\n3\n4 exec ( VALIDATE_CODE_TEMPLATE )\n```\n```\n```\n```python\n1 EVAL_INPUT_PREDICTION_TEMPLATE = \"\"\" { code }\n2 { gold_output } == f({ agent_input }) \"\"\"\n3\n4 exec ( EVAL_INPUT_PREDICTION_TEMPLATE )\n```\n```\n<span id=\"page-22-0\"></span>*Figure 10.* **Python Code to Check Agent Input Abduction Correctness.**\n```\n```python\n1 EVAL_OUTPUT_PREDICTION_TEMPLATE = \"\"\" { code }\n2 eval ({ gold_output }) == eval ({ agent_output }) \"\"\"\n3\n4 exec ( EVAL_OUTPUT_PREDICTION_TEMPLATE )\n```\n```\n*Figure 11.* **Python Code to Check Agent Output Deduction Correctness.**\n```\n```python\n1 EVAL_FUNCTION_PREDICTION_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"{ code }\n2 matches = []\n3 for gold_input , gold_output in zip ({ gold_inputs } , { gold_outputs }):\n4 match = { gold_output } == f({ gold_input })\n5 matches . append ( match )\n6 \"\"\"\n7\n8 exec ( EVAL_OUTPUT_PREDICTION_TEMPLATE )\n```\n```\n<span id=\"page-22-1\"></span>*Figure 12.* **Python Code to Check Agent Function Induction Correctness.**\n```\n```python\n1 CHECK_DETERMINISM_TEMPLATE = \"\"\"{ code }\n2 returns = f({ inputs })\n3 if returns != f({ inputs }):\n4 raise Exception ( 'Non - deterministic code ')\n5 repr ( returns ) \"\"\"\n6\n7 exec ( CHECK_DETERMINISM_TEMPLATE )\n```\n```\n![](_page_22_Figure_8.jpeg)\n*Figure 13.* **Python Code to Check Deterministic Program.**\n<span id=\"page-22-2\"></span>*Figure 14.* **In-distribution Benchmark Score During Training.** The evolution of CruxEval-I, CruxEval-O, and LiveCodeBench-Execution during training for the Qwen2.5-7B base model trained using AZR.\n![](_page_23_Figure_1.jpeg)\n<span id=\"page-23-0\"></span>*Figure 15.* **Abduction Task Reward and Token Lengths.** The task reward and token lengths of the two roles for abduction task type of Absolute Zero Reasoner-base-7b.\n![](_page_23_Figure_3.jpeg)\n*Figure 16.* **Induction Task Reward and Token Lengths.** The task reward and token lengths of the two roles for induction task type of Absolute Zero Reasoner-base-7b.\n![](_page_24_Figure_1.jpeg)\n<span id=\"page-24-1\"></span>*Figure 17.* **Deduction Task Reward and Token Lengths.** The task reward and token lengths of the two roles for deduction task type of Absolute Zero Reasoner-base-7b.

However, this task will involve multiple steps, increasing its complexity and creativity. We will create a function 'f' that transforms a jumbled list of elements into a two-dimensional matrix, then back to a list, given a specifc reconstruction pattern. We will retrieve the original list from the reconstructed matrix. Here, we will avoid random and datetime operations to ensure determinism.

The function replaces each number in the list according to a specifc dictionary and then sums up the replaced numbers. Let's analyze the dictionary:\nThis dictionary tells us that:\n-0 becomes 2\n-1 becomes 3\n-2 becomes 1\n-3 becomes 0\n-4 remains 4\nTo create diverse outputs, we should include lists with diferent sets of numbers from the list {0*,* 1*,* 2*,* 3*,* 4}. We also need to ensure that the inputs are valid (i.e., lists of integers).\nLet's illustrate using provided examples step-by-step:\n1. Input: [0] \u21d2 Replacement: [2] \u21d2 sum = 2 2. Input: [1, 2, 3] \u21d2 Replacement: [3*,* 1*,* 0] \u21d2 sum = 4 3. Input: [4, 1] \u21d2 Replacement: [4*,* 3] \u21d2 sum = 7 4. Input: [2, 1, 0] \u21d2 Replacement: [1*,* 3*,* 2] \u21d2 sum = 6 5.

Input: [2, 2, 0, 1] \u21d2 Replacement: [1*,* 1*,* 2*,* 3] \u21d2 sum = 7 8. Input: [3, 4, 2] \u21d2 Replacement: [0*,* 4*,* 1] \u21d2 sum = 5 9.

The function f takes a list of integers numbers and a target integer target. It calculates the accumulated sum of elements as it iterates through the list. Then, it checks for each pair of accumulated sums if their diference equals the target. If such a pair is found, it returns the accumulated sum at the frst index of the pair.\nTo fnd one possible input that produces the output 1, we need to fnd a scenario where the diference between any two accumulated\\_values equals the target, and the frst accumulated\\_values that satisfes this condition is 1. Let's consider a simple example: -numbers = [1, 2] -target = 1 Here's the step-by-step calculation: 1. current\\_sum = 0 + 1 = 1, accumulated\\_values = [1] 2. current\\_sum = 1 + 2 = 3, accumulated\\_values = [1, 3] -Check for pair (i=0, j=1): 3 - 1 = 2 (not equal to target) -Check for pair (i=0, j=0): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target) -Check for pair (i=1, j=1): 3 - 3 = 0 (not equal to target) Since no pair satisfes the condition, the function will not return any value. This doesn't match our output. Let's try another example. Consider: -numbers = [1, 0] -target = 1 Step-by-step calculation: 1. current\\_sum = 0 + 1 = 1, accumulated\\_values = [1] 2. current\\_sum = 1 + 0 = 1, accumulated\\_values = [1, 1] -Check for pair (i=0, j=1): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target) -Check for pair (i=0, j=0): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target) -Check for pair (i=1, j=1): 1 - 1 = 0 (not equal to target) ...(shortened) The pair (i=1, j=2) satisfes the condition, and the function returns the frst accumulated value in this pair, which is 3. This still doesn't match our output. Given the complexity and the fact that no simple example seems to work, let's try a more complex scenario: -numbers = [2, -1, 1] -target = 1 Step-by-step calculation: 1. current\\_sum = 0 + 2 = 2, accumulated\\_values = [2] 2. current\\_sum = 2 - 1 = 1, accumulated\\_values = [2, 1] 3. current\\_sum = 1 + 1 = 2, accumulated\\_values = [2, 1, 2] -Check for pair (i=0, j=1): 1 - 2 = -1 (not equal to target) -Check for pair (i=0, j=2): 2 - 2 = 0 (not equal to target) -Check for pair (i=1, j=2): 2 - 1 = 1 (equal to target) The pair (i=1, j=2) satisfes the condition, and the function returns the frst accumulated value in this pair, which is 1. This matches our output. Therefore, one possible input that could produce the output 1 is: [2, -1, 1], 1\nFigure 22. A more detailed version of the example shown in main Figure 7.

Specifically, we log two sets of metrics: program complexity and task diversity. For complexity, we employ two proxy measures\u2014ComplexiPy score and the Halstead metric. To assess diversity, we compute the average abstract syntax tree (AST) edit distance between the proposed program and a set of *K* reference programs, and an answer diversity metric. We calculate this answer diversity metric by tracking all historical answers to the generated questions, i.e., the input-output pairs, and form a categorical distribution over these outputs. We define answer diversity as <sup>1</sup> <sup>\u2212</sup> *<sup>p</sup>*(answer), where *<sup>p</sup>*(answer) is the empirical probability of a specific answer\u2014used as a proxy for the diversity of generated outputs.\nWe present these metrics in Figure [27.](#page-33-1) Interestingly, even without incorporating them explicitly into the reward function, the policy appears to implicitly optimize for these metrics. This aligns well with intuitive notions of task difficulty and diversity, and that the policy learned to propose increasingly challenging tasks over time using our proposed simple reward function in Equation [\\(4\\)](#page-4-1)."

It is designed to fnd all pairs of numbers in num\\_list whose product equals target\\_product. The function then returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a pair of numbers that satisfy the condition.\nLet's go through the code step by step:\n1. Initialize an empty list result\\_pairs to store pairs whose product equals target\\_product.\n2. Use nested loops to iterate through each pair of numbers in num\\_list. The outer loop iterates over each number, and the inner loop iterates over numbers that come after the current number in the outer loop (**\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53cd\u5411\u7684\u5bf9\u5b50,\u4f8b\u5982 (2, 3) \u548c (3, 2)**)\u3002 3. For each pair (num\\_list[i], num\\_list[j]), check if their product equals target\\_product.\n4. If the product equals target\\_product, append the tuple (num\\_list[i], num\\_list[j]) to result\\_pairs.\n5. After all pairs have been checked, return the list result\\_pairs.\nLet's explicitly apply this to the provided input [2, 3, 5, 7, 10], target product 10:\n```\n```python\n- For i=0 (num_list[0] = 2):\n- j=1, 2 \u00d7 3 = 6 (\u226010)\n- j=2, 2 \u00d7 5 = 10 (=10), add pair (2, 5)\n- j=3, 2 \u00d7 7 = 14 (\u226010)\n- j=4, 2 \u00d7 10 = 20 (\u226010)\n- For i=1 (num_list[1] = 3):\n- j=2, 3 \u00d7 5 = 15 (\u226010)\n- j=3, 3 \u00d7 7 = 21 (\u226010)\n- j=4, 3 \u00d7 10 = 30 (\u226010)\n- For i=2 (num_list[2] = 5):\n- j=3, 5 \u00d7 7 = 35 (\u226010)\n- j=4, 5 \u00d7 10 = 50 (\u226010)\n- For i=3 (num_list[3] = 7):\n- j=4, 7 \u00d7 10 = 70 (\u226010)\n- For i=4 (num_list[4] = 10):\n- No further pairs to check\nThus, the only pair satisfying the condition is (2, 5). Therefore, the output is:\n[(2, 5)]\n```\n```\nFigure 25. An example of the model solving an deduction task.

It then assigns this value to the variable \"'slice\\_out\\_string\"'.\nThe third line, 'if (slice\\_out\\_string == substring)' checks whether the \"'slice\\_out\\_string\"' is equal to the value of substring. Because curr\\_index is set to \"codecandide\", \"code\" appears on the left of the frst index in input\\_string, and thus, \"'slice\\_out\\_string\"' assumes the value \"code\". That means for a minute the \"'if statement\"' is satisfed and will continue the code execution afterwards.

We experimented with this additional task alongside the induction (*f*), deduction (*o*), and abduction (*i*) tasks.

Composite Functions as Curriculum Learning**\", \"hash\": \"e3b0c44298fc1c14\"}] -->\nOne valuable property we can leverage from programming languages is the ability to compose functions\u2014that is, to define a function as a composite of other functions, i.e., *f*(*g*(*x*)). In our setting, when generating a program, we can not only require the output to be a valid program but also constrain the LLM to utilize a predefined set of programs within its main function. For example, if the target program to be generated is *<sup>f</sup>*(\u00b7), we can sample a set of previously generated programs {*g*\\_0*, . . . , gc*} from <sup>D</sup>, and force a valid program to be *<sup>f</sup>*(*g*\\_0*,* \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 *, gc, i*).\nSince all programs are generated by the LLM itself, this setup allows the model to bootstrap from its earlier generations, automatically increasing the complexity of the generated programs. We interpret this mechanism as a form of curriculum learning: earlier programs in the AZR self-play loop tend to be simpler, and as the loop progresses, they become increasingly complex. By composing newer programs from progressively more difficult earlier ones, the resulting programs naturally inherit this growing difficulty, which in turn challenges the solver step.\nFor implementation, in generating tasks for abduction and deduction, we begin by sampling a binary decision from a binomial distribution with *p* = 0*.*5. This determines whether the generated program should be a simple program or a composite one. If the sample is 0, we prompt the LLM to generate a standard program along with a corresponding input. If the sample is 1, we prompt the LLM to generate a composite program. To construct the composite, we first sample an integer *<sup>c</sup>* \u223c U(1*,* 3), then uniformly select *<sup>c</sup>* programs from the dataset <sup>D</sup> that are not themselves composite programs. Finally, we prompt the LLM to generate a valid program that incorporates {*g*\\_0*, . . . , gc*} as subcomponents, ensuring it composes these selected programs meaningfully. We additionally filter programs that did not utilize all the *c* programs.\nHowever, we did not observe a significant difference when using this more complex curriculum compared to our simpler and more effective approach. One failure mode we encountered was that the model often defaulted to simply returning \"g(x)\", effectively learning *f*(*g*(*x*)) = *g*(*x*), which failed to introduce any additional difficulty. This trivial behavior undermined the intended challenge, leading us to deprioritize further exploration in this direction. While it may be possible to design a stricter reward mechanism\u2014such as enforcing *<sup>f</sup>*(*g*(*x*)) \u0338<sup>=</sup> *<sup>g</sup>*(*x*) by executing the code via a Python interpreter and penalizing such shortcuts\u2014we leave this to future work."

We observed an increase in initial performance on coding benchmarks; however, the performance plateaued at roughly the same level after additional training steps, compared to our official AZR setup. Interestingly, math performance was lower than in the official AZR setup, pointing towards that on-policy data may be more beneficial to the learner to bootstrap from for mathematical reasoning. We believe that exploring different strategies for initializing and updating *p*(*z*) is an important and exciting direction for future research. We briefly explored different strategies for sampling reference code, ultimately settling on uniform sampling for its simplicity, though we also experimented with recency-based sampling and observed potential collapse."

Therefore, for the problem proposer, we can add various measures of complexity\u2014such as Cyclomatic Complexity [\\(Ebert et al.,](#page-14-15) [2016\\)](#page-14-15), maintainability, etc.\u2014to the reward function to incentivize the proposer to produce more complex programs. For illustration purposes, we tried using the Maintainability measure and the Halstead complexity measure [\\(Halstead,](#page-14-16) [1977\\)](#page-14-16) as intrinsic rewards. Concretely, we used the complexipy and Radon packages [\\(Lopez,](#page-15-18) [2025;](#page-15-18) [Canal,](#page-13-12) [2023\\)](#page-13-12) to implement the respective metrics. These are then served as intrinsic rewards during the AZR self-play phase.\n**Diversity Rewards.** We also attempted using diversity rewards to . Inspired by DiveR-CT [\\(Zhao et al.,](#page-18-2) [2025a\\)](#page-18-2), we incorporate *code edit distance* as an intrinsic reward. Specifically, we treat the reference programs shown in the prompt as anchors and compute the average code edit distance between the generated program and these anchors. This serves as a measure of diversity in the generated output. Additionally, we explored another diversity-based reward inspired by the notion of *surprise* [\\(Zhao et al.,](#page-18-4) [2022\\)](#page-18-4). In this approach, we construct a probability distribution over previously encountered input/output pairs that the solver has answered. The reward is then defined as <sup>1</sup> <sup>\u2212</sup> *<sup>p</sup>*(input/output), where *<sup>p</sup>* denotes the empirical probability of a particular input or output. While both strategies were evaluated in our experiments, we did not observe a significant difference in performance. However, we believe this aspect warrants deeper investigation, as diversity rewards remain a promising avenue for strengthening AZR further.\n**Reward Aggregation.** We tested several ways on how to combine rewards for the proposer and discriminator. First, we separate the reward into extrinsic reward *<sup>r</sup>*extrinsic and a set of intrinsic reward(s) *<sup>I</sup>* <sup>=</sup> {*ri*}, and tested the following strategies to combine them into a single reward,\n$$r = r\\_{\\text{extrinsic}} + \\sum\\_{i}^{|I|} r\\_i,\\tag{11}$$\n<span id=\"page-49-1\"></span>\n$$r = r\\_{\\text{extinsic}} \\cdot \\sum\\_{i}^{|\\mathcal{I}|} r\\_i,\\tag{12}$$\n$$r = r\\_{\\text{extrinsic}} \\cdot \\prod\\_{i}^{|I|} r\\_i,\\tag{13}$$\n$$r = r\\_{\\text{extrinsic}} + \\prod\\_{i}^{|\\mathcal{I}|} r\\_i. \\tag{14}$$\nWe found that the simple additive way of combining rewards, a.k.a Equation [\\(11\\)](#page-49-1), produced the most stable runs, possibly due to less variance."

Specifically, after generating a piece of code, we can apply a transformation function on it before giving it making it an valid tuple in our dataset. We investigated two\n**Removing Comments and Docstrings** In early iterations of our experiments, we noticed that comments and docstrings were sometimes used to explicitly outline what the function was doing, or even served as a partial \"note-taking\" interleaved \"ReAct\" process [\\(Yao et al.,](#page-17-1) [2023\\)](#page-17-1) of generating code\u2014that is, the model could interleave think and action at the same time, and to make the generated code valid, it used comments to encase its thoughts (Appendix [C.3\\)](#page-24-0), similarly observed in DeepSeek-Prover-V2: [\\(Ren et al.,](#page-15-3) [2025\\)](#page-15-3). We then thought that to make the task harder for the solver, we should occlude this information from it. However, we observed a significant performance drop after removing all comments and docstrings. One explanation for this phenomenon is that the only \"communication\" channel between the proposer and the solver is restricted to the code itself, rather than some kind of \"message\" along with the code. These messages can potentially provide hints to the solver, thus making some otherwise impossible tasks solvable. As a result, the solver is able to learn from its experience and self-bootstrap out of certain unsolvable tasks.\n**Removing Global Variables.** We observed that some programs contain globally declared variables that may inadvertently leak information about the correct answer\u2014this issue is particularly prevalent in the input induction task generation and solving. Initially, we were concerned that such leakage might lead to wasted computation on trivial or compromised examples. To address this, we developed a systematic procedure to remove globally declared variables from the generated programs.\nHowever, after applying this cleaning step, we observed a noticeable drop in performance on our self-play reasoning tasks. One possible explanation is that the generation step is unaware of this post-processing modification; since the reward is assigned after the transition function (which includes variable removal), the model may not learn effectively from this mismatch.\nMoreover, we believe that even when answers are present, the solver still engages in nontrivial reasoning to reach a solution, potentially benefiting from this exposure. This aligns with the idea of rationalization as proposed in STaR [\\(Zelikman et al.,](#page-17-16) [2022\\)](#page-17-16), where the model pretends to not see the answer but still performs reasoning during learning. Therefore, in our final experiments, we choose not to remove globally declared variables, allowing the self-play loop to naturally incorporate and adapt to such cases."
